However, it should work in ***most*** linux based Jupyter Notebooks or Jupyter Lab environments.  The main purpose of the notebook is to install relevant python libraries, execute the web scrapping code, and save the output to a cloud repository.   \n",

The Detroit Three automakers and their suppliers began restarting assembly lines on Monday after a two-month coronavirus lockdown in a slow revival of a sector that employs nearly 1 million people in the United States.  The Toledo plant supplies axles for such popular models as Fiat Chrysler Automobiles\\\\u2019 (FCHA.MI)(FCAU.N) Jeep Wrangler and Gladiator, and Ford Motor Co\\\\u2019s (F.N) Ranger pickup. Trucks and SUVs are among the auto industry\\\\u2019s most profitable vehicles.  Hourly workers at the plant are represented by UAW Local 12, which also represents employees at the nearby FCA Jeep plant.  Assembly technician Brandon Green, 32, of Toledo said he was \\\\u201cokay\\\\u201d with the safety precautions put in place at the plant. \\\\u201cI\\\\u2019m not really nervous. They worked with us pretty well to get us what we need,\\\\u201d he said.  Among those precautions are staggered entrances and exits for workers, who get thermal temperature checks and are given face masks - although some have opted to wear their own facial coverings, including at least one with an American flag motif. Throughout the plant, yellow Xs remind people where to stand for proper social distancing.  Workers are responsible for cleaning their immediate work areas at the beginning and end of each shift. Overnight, a maintenance crew cleans and disinfects the plant with fogging machines.  The plant\\\\u2019s UAW shop chairman, 61-year-old Mark Popovich of Toledo, said, \\\\u201cWe\\\\u2019ve got a good mood today. Everybody understands that we have to go back to work.

Drugmaker Moderna Inc (MRNA.O) surged 19.96% after the company said its experimental COVID-19 vaccine showed promising results in a small early-stage trial.  After rallying more than 32% from a multi-year low hit in March, the S&P 500 had been trading in a tight range in May as investors weighed the hopes of an economic recovery against the fears of another wave of infection as states lifted virus-led restrictions.  \\\\u201cThe fact that Moderna came out with the Phase 1 trial that seems to be positive, that certainly is igniting the storm,\\\\u201d said Ken Polcari, chief market strategist at SlateStone Wealth LLC in Jupiter, Florida. \\\\u201cThat will ignite the storm because if there is a vaccine then all this uncertainty about the economy and the virus goes away.\\\\u201d   Stocks that have been particularly battered by government lockdown measures implemented to stem the spread of the coronavirus surged on Monday.   Travel-related stocks were among the biggest gainers, with cruise line operators Carnival Corp (CCL.N), Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd (NCLH.N) all outperforming the broader market with gains of at least 15%.   Airline stocks also soared as Delta Air Lines (DAL.N) said it would resume flying several major routes in June. The NYSE Arca index .XAL gained 14.14%, with Delta up 13.91%.   The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 911.95 points, or 3.85%, to 24,597.37, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 90.21 points, or 3.15%, to 2,953.91 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 220.27 points, or 2.44%, to 9,234.83.  The benchmark S&P 500 notched its biggest one-day percentage gain since April 8, with all 11 major S&P sectors higher.  Markets also took heart from comments by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell over the weekend forecasting a gradual economic recovery and his affirmation that more monetary stimulus would be on the way if required. Powell is set to speak before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday to discuss how economic rescue efforts are working.  Cyclical plays were in favor with the energy .SPNY and industrial .SPLRCI sectors climbing as a gradual recovery in economic activity pointed to more demand for oil and manufactured products.  Still, stocks that are poised to benefit the most from a restart of the economy continue to lag those whose businesses have weathered the restrictions or even grown as a result of the lockdowns. The S&P 500 growth index .IGX has outperformed the S&P value index .IVX by about 4 percentage points this month.       General Motors Co (GM.N) and Ford Motor Co (F.N) both surged, closing up 9.63% and 8.37%, respectively, as the two automakers started to reopen their North American factories in a push to restart work in an industry that accounts for about 6% of U.S. economic activity and employs nearly 1 million people in the United States.  Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 7.12-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 4.43-to-1 ratio favored advancers.  The S&P 500 posted 22 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 88 new highs and seven new lows.

A group of protesters threw rocks, shouted and burned piles of wood along a street in the destitute neighborhood on Santiago\\\\u2019s southern fringe. Images on social media and local television showed police spraying tear gas and water cannons to disperse the growing crowd.   The municipality said in a statement that families were going hungry in the poorest sectors of El Bosque, a neighborhood where many work informally, or not at all. The city district has been under quarantine since mid-April, city officials said in a statement.  \\\\u201cThe last weeks we have had a great demand from neighbors for food,\\\\u201d El Bosque Mayor Sadi Melo, of Chile\\\\u00b4s opposition Socialist party, told Radio BioBio. \\\\u201cWe are in a very complex situation of hunger and lack of work.\\\\u201d  Santiago is one of Latin America\\\\u00b4s most prosperous cities. But a stark rich-poor divide and a growing sense of inequality prompted mass protests in late 2019. Many of the demands lodged by protesters last year, from increased pensions to higher pay, remain unresolved.  In a statement, Melo\\\\u00b4s office said El Bosque had distributed more than 2,000 aid packages to the neediest families. But it warned the central government \\\\u201cnot to continue to burden municipalities with an economic responsibility we cannot cover.\\\\u201d  Chile\\\\u00b4s center-right president, Sebastian Pinera, said in a televised address later on Monday that his government would deliver 2.5 million baskets of food and cleaning supplies directly to homes by late this week or early next.  \\\\u201cWe will prioritize the most vulnerable families,\\\\u201d Pinera said, calling the planned delivery of food \\\\u201chistoric.\\\\u201d   The South American nation has already announced a massive stimulus package worth nearly 7% of gross domestic product to ease the economic impact of the pandemic, although opposition leaders and social groups have criticized the package as inadequate.   The government\\\\u00b4s proposed measures include beefed-up  unemployment checks, deferred tax payments and government-backed credit lines for small business.   Chile surpassed 40,000 cases of the new coronavirus last week amid a sharp spike in infections that has seen hospitals approach collapse in the weeks ahead of the Southern Hemisphere winter.

The country halted regular passenger flights and closed most public venues to combat the disease but like other Gulf Arab states saw the virus spread among low-income migrant workers living in overcrowded quarters, leading to an increase in testing.   Authorities have arranged repatriation flights for citizens and a limited number of residents and to evacuate foreigners.  The state news agency said residents with relatives in the UAE could start returning as of June 1 to reunite with family.  Some emirates, including business and tourism hub Dubai, allowed malls to reopen at limited capacity during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan that began on April 24. Dubai has also allowed dine-in restaurants and cafes to resume business at 30% capacity and public parks to reopen with restrictions.  Dhaheri urged those celebrating the Eid al-Fitr holiday that marks the end of Ramadan to avoid family gatherings. He said malls could operate from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. during Eid with shoppers allowed to be there for a maximum of two hours.  Another official detailed an updated list of penalties for violation of containment measures, including a fine of 50,000 dirhams ($13,000) for not heeding quarantine orders and 3,000 dirhams for not wearing a face mask or practicing physical distancing in public, or breaking curfew.   The official said the public prosecutor would impose penalties of up to six months in prison or a fine of no less than 100,000 dirhams for repeat offenders.

Boeing has appointed former engineering and development chief Mike Delaney to head wider efforts to build  confidence, and Airbus leaders say the industry is moving from an initial crisis phase to securing public trust.  That has triggered, among other things, a concerted effort to explain how cabin air filtration works in a bid to scotch the myth that the pressurised fuselage contains only static or recycled air.  Health officials are still quantifying various sources of transmission for COVID-19 disease caused by the virus, but attention focuses on the risk of catching it from airborne droplets from coughing or sneezing passengers as well as from  touching infected surfaces.  The air-travel industry historically talks more about seat pitch than air quality. That\\\\u2019s had to change as a result of the pandemic.   \\\\u201cIt\\\\u2019s about explaining what we do for the safety of passengers in the large sense: aircraft safety but also sanitary safety,\\\\u201d Airbus engineering head Jean-Brice Dumont said.  In an office building, air is exchanged about four times every hour. On a modern jet aircraft, that rises to 20 to 30 times.  \\\\u201cThe air system on an airplane is as good as anything you will be exposed to,\\\\u201d Delaney said. Air circulation is only one of several techniques for reducing potential for the virus to spread on board including rigorous cleaning of the plane and screening passengers for signs of illness, he added.  In most cases compressed air is fed from the clean part of an engine - untainted by fuel which is added later - to air conditioning packs and from there to fans in the cabin ceiling.  Both planemakers say cabin air pours downwards not lengthways through the fuselage, reducing risks of infection.      Half that air is then recycled through hospital-grade HEPA filters designed to remove some 99.97% of contaminants including viruses. The other half is flushed outside through valves.  Planemakers say cabin air is renewed every two to three minutes, though scientists caution that in reality, air is always a blend. But the quicker the rate, the faster old air is diluted.  \\\\u201cThe air turns over very, very quickly in the aircraft in terms of air-exchange rate. From that point of view the aircraft systems are very good,\\\\u201d said Professor Byron Jones of Kansas State University, who has helped recommend air standards.  But air flow isn\\\\u2019t the only part of a complex equation.  \\\\u201cThe biggest challenge you have on an aircraft is the extremely high occupant density. You have got a lot of people crammed into a small space, and you have to get a lot of air in there to ventilate that space to maintain the air quality,\\\\u201d Jones said.  The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say the virus is thought to spread between people in close contact or   less than 6 feet apart, around half the width of many cabins.   Air currents over such short distances are said to be hardest to predict. Passengers have some control through the individual air outlets nicknamed \\\\u201cgaspers\\\\u201d above each seat.   On average, twisting them on makes things \\\\u201ca little bit better, but there is no guarantee,\\\\u201d Jones said.   Although filtered, the pinpoint blasts of air could in a worst case push nearby virus particles across a passenger\\\\u2019s face. On the other hand, the air shower could have the positive effect of limiting sideways movements of air.  Faced with such questions, Boeing and Airbus have deployed  engineers to examine seat-to-seat air flows - using the same advanced physics at play in wind-tunnel testing of a wing.  \\\\u201cWe are actively running simulations to see whether we could recommend something for the individual air jets, \\\\u201c Dumont said.  The spectre of in-flight contamination dates back at least to the SARS epidemic in 2003, though no link has been proved.  In March that year, a 72-year-old man infected with SARS, which is also a coronavirus, took a flight from Hong Kong to Beijing. At least 22 of the 119 passengers and two crew later developed the illness.  It was the only significant case of in-flight transmission but prompted measures to prevent ill passengers boarding planes.   Such \\\\u201ckerb-to-kerb\\\\u201d measures must again be part of the strategy to keep the new virus off planes, Delaney said. Research on technology like ultraviolet-cleaning systems and anti-microbial materials may join the fight in the future.

The two biggest EU countries, whose agreements usually pave the way for broader EU deals, proposed that the European Commission borrow the money on behalf of the whole EU and spend it as an additional top-up to the 2021-2027 EU budget that is already close to 1 trillion euros over that period.  \\\\u201cThat\\\\u2019s a real change in philosophy,\\\\u201d French President Emmanuel Macron said. \\\\u201cI believe this is a very deep transformation and that\\\\u2019s what the European Union and the single market needed to remain coherent. It\\\\u2019s what the euro zone needs to remain united.\\\\u201d  The proposal moves the EU more in the direction of a transfer union and is likely to please countries like Italy or Spain which have long called for more joint action in response to the crisis.  But offering grants rather than loans could be hard to swallow for some of the frugal northern countries of the 27-nation bloc, like the Netherlands, Finland and Austria.  \\\\u201cOur position remains unchanged. We are ready to help most affected countries with loans,\\\\u201d Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said on Twitter. \\\\u201cWe expect the updated (EU budget) to reflect the new priorities rather than raising the ceiling.\\\\u201d  The euro jumped against the dollar EUR= to 1.0912 from 1.0851 on the news and bond yields in Italy, one of the hardest hit by the pandemic and which has a huge public debt, fell to a one-month low of 1.67% from 1.79% IT10YT=RR.  Still, grants from the Recovery Fund will have strings attached - they are to be \\\\u201cbased on a clear commitment from Member States to follow sound economic policies and an ambitious reform agenda\\\\u201d the document said.  The money is to be spent particularly on investment in the EU\\\\u2019s transition to a more \\\\u201cgreen\\\\u201d and digital economy and boost research and innovation.  It is to be paid for through the EU budget that will come after 2027, the Franco-German document said.  France and Germany did not specify whether that would mean higher national contributions based on the size of each economy or some new taxes that would be earmarked for the EU, or a combination of both.  German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the 500 billion euros should be paid back over a long time and that Berlin would shoulder roughly 27% of the funds, as it already does for the regular EU budget.  \\\\u201cWe must act in a European way so that we get out of the crisis well and strengthened,\\\\u201d Merkel told reporters.  France and Germany had previously struggled to present a united front in the coronavirus crisis as France lead a push by mostly southern countries to get fiscally conservative northerners, including Germany, to issue joint European debt to help them recover from the deepest ever recession, which is now expected to come this year.  Macron said the plan was a result of \\\\u201cclose cooperation\\\\u201d with Italy and the Netherlands - diplomatic language indicating the two countries had been consulted.  \\\\u201cWe will consider proposals and ideas like the French and Germans have done. Eventually there must be a proposal from the European Commission and that will be the starting point for the discussions,\\\\u201d said Stephan Schrover, a spokesman for Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte.  The European Commission is to present its own proposal for a Recovery Fund linked to the EU\\\\u2019s next long-term budget on May 27th and said it welcomed the initiative from Paris and Berlin.  \\\\u201cIt acknowledges the scope and the size of the economic challenge that Europe faces, and rightly puts the emphasis on the need to work on a solution with the European budget at its core,\\\\u201d Commission head Ursula von der Leyen said.  \\\\u201cThis goes in the direction of the proposal the Commission is working on which will also take into account the views of all member States and the European Parliament,\\\\u201d she said.  The European Parliament has called in a resolution for governments to assign new, dedicated revenue streams to the EU budget so that it can pay back the money the Commission would borrow to pay for the grants.  Among possible new revenue sources for the EU budget, which now gets its money from national contributions, a cut of national VAT and customs and sugar levies, the parliament has listed a plastics tax, a digital tax, a financial transactions tax and a levy on goods imported into the EU from countries that have lower CO2 emissions standards than the EU.

Closing in on a deal after two months of often bitter talks, the European Union\\\\u2019s biggest powers proposed a fund on Monday that would offer non-repayable grants to EU regions and sectors hit hardest by the pandemic, with the cash borrowed by the bloc as a whole rather than by individual member states.  Although the plan still requires the consent of all EU members, it would be a big step towards debt mutualisation, once a taboo for German governments fearing that their taxpayers might be liable for the fiscal irresponsibility of others.  \\\\u201cThe Franco-German proposals are ambitious, targeted and, of course, welcome,\\\\u201d Lagarde said in a joint interview with four European newspapers, after announcement of the plan sent the euro higher and reduced Italian bond yields.  \\\\u201cThey pave the way for the European Commission to borrow funds over the long term and, above all, they allow a substantial amount of direct support to be provided to the countries most affected by the crisis,\\\\u201d Lagarde told newspapers Les Echos, Handelsblatt, Corriere della Sera and El Mundo.  Buying 1.1 trillion euros of debt this year, the ECB would be expected to buy any bonds jointly issued by EU members, keeping borrowing costs down and increasing the pool of coveted safe assets.  The euro zone economy is expected to shrink by a tenth this year, and even with many coronavirus restrictions already lifted, the recovery is expected to last well beyond this year.  Reflecting on a recent German Constitutional Court ruling that the ECB exceeded its powers with sovereign bond buys, Lagarde said the German central bank is under obligation to carry out the ECB\\\\u2019s decision.   \\\\u201cAccording to the Treaty, all national central banks should fully participate in the determination and implementation of monetary policy in the euro area,\\\\u201d she said.  Her comments may foreshadow a legal clash as the German court said the Bundesbank must quit the asset buys unless the ECB can prove they are necessary.

The complaint is the latest salvo from voting rights activists, who have filed dozens of lawsuits around the country to increase ballot access, such as universal vote-by-mail, in light of the coronavirus pandemic.  Wisconsin was at the center of the battle in April, when a last-minute effort by Democratic Governor Tony Evers to postpone the primary election was stymied after Republican legislative leaders challenged his order in court. With many polling places shut down due to a lack of poll workers, many voters waited in long lines, risking infection.

The burdens fell disproportionately on minority, disabled and immuno-compromised voters, according to the lawsuit, which was filed by Disability Rights Wisconsin, Black Leaders Organizing for Communities and three individual Wisconsinites.  A spokesman for the state elections commission, which was named as a defendant, declined to comment on pending litigation.  Also on Monday, the League of Women Voters of New Jersey and other groups sued New Jersey in federal court, arguing that the state\\\\u2019s signature-match requirement for mail-in ballots disenfranchises thousands of voters, particularly immigrants, minorities, the elderly and the disabled.  The two lawsuits join a plethora of others as activists warn that the ongoing coronavirus outbreak could throw November\\\\u2019s election into chaos without immediate steps to make it easier for voters to cast ballots by mail.  Many of the lawsuits are backed by Democrats, who argue they are trying to protect voters\\\\u2019 rights in a public health crisis and that Republican resistance is intended to disenfranchise minority and other voters who tend to vote Democratic. Marc Elias, the attorney leading the party\\\\u2019s efforts, has pending cases in 17 different states  Republicans have argued that loosening restrictions could increase the potential for voter fraud, though examples in the United States are exceedingly rare.

(Reuters) - Businesses in the San Francisco Bay Area may open for curbside retail and manufacturing, while fan-free professional sports events might be allowed as soon as June, as California continued to loosen coronavirus health restrictions on Monday.  California Governor Gavin Newsom said Monday the state has been in discussions with officials of all of the major sports leagues about a possible resumption of play. But rules aimed at protecting players and support staff from coronavirus-transmission have yet to be developed, and a possible June 1 opening date would depend on safety standards and infection rates in the most populous U.S. state.  Newsom eased rules for local counties to make it easier for them to open restaurants for sit-down dining and retail outlets for in-store shopping.   In the San Francisco Bay Area, which was hit hard and early by the virus, health directors of five counties moved to loosen some restrictions that had lagged other parts of the state.  Businesses in those counties - San Francisco, Alameda, Santa Clara, Marin and Contra Costa - may open for manufacturing, retail with curbside pickup and warehouse distribution.  The modest loosening of public health restrictions put in place to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus pandemic comes after the number of new cases in the heavily populated region has remained stable or decreased over a two-week period, the directors said.  The San Francisco area, which includes California\\\\u2019s storied Silicon Valley technology hub and the massive University of California at Berkeley, was the first in the state to report a cluster of coronavirus infections and the first to order residents to shelter at home.  In their new order issued Monday, the health directors said residents should still stay mostly at home, and requires people to wear face coverings when they are out. San Mateo County, which includes San Francisco International Airport, updated its health orders last week.   Nearly all 50 U.S. states were at some stage of reopening on Monday as authorities eased restrictions imposed to contain the spread of the new coronavirus and stock markets rose on results of an early test of a potential vaccine.

Reporting by Jeff Mason and Steve Holland; Editing by Sandra Maler\",\"17\":\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump may have fired State Department Inspector General Steve Linick because he was investigating U.S. military sales to Saudi Arabia, Democratic lawmakers said on Monday, although Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he sought Linick\\\\u2019s removal because his work was undermining the department.  Trump announced the planned removal of Linick in a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi late on Friday. He was the fourth government inspector general that the Republican president has ousted in recent weeks.  Pompeo told the Washington Post in an interview that he had asked Trump to fire Linick, while declining to describe specific concerns. Pompeo said no reason had to be given, a statement that contradicted members of Congress\\\\u2019 interpretation of the inspector general law.  \\\\u201cJust like every presidentially confirmed position, I can terminate them. They serve at his pleasure for any reason or no reason,\\\\u201d Pompeo told the newspaper.  \\\\u201cI went to the president and made clear to him that Inspector General Linick wasn\\\\u2019t performing a function in a way that we had tried to get him to, that was additive for the State Department,\\\\u201d Pompeo said.  Another State official also told the Post that concern over Linick had grown because of leaks to the news media about investigations, although there was no evidence Linick was responsible for the leaks.  Representative Eliot Engel, chairman of the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee, and Senator Bob Menendez, ranking member on Senate Foreign Relations, said Linick had been investigating Trump\\\\u2019s declaration of a national emergency last year to clear the way for $8 billion in military sales, mostly to Saudi Arabia.  Engel and Menendez announced on Saturday they were launching an investigation of Linick\\\\u2019s firing. On Monday, Engel disclosed Linick\\\\u2019s probe into the Saudi arms sales.  \\\\u201cI have learned that there may be another reason for Mr. Linick\\\\u2019s firing. His office was investigating - at my request - Trump\\\\u2019s phony declaration of an emergency so he could send weapons to Saudi Arabia,\\\\u201d Engel said in a statement.  \\\\u201cWe don\\\\u2019t have the full picture yet, but it\\\\u2019s troubling that Secretary (Mike) Pompeo wanted Mr. Linick pushed out before this work could be completed,\\\\u201d he said, calling on the administration to comply with the probe and turn over records by Friday.  The White House, State Department and Saudi embassy in Washington did not respond to questions about Engel\\\\u2019s statement, first reported by the Washington Post.  Congressional aides had also said Linick was investigating whether Pompeo misused a taxpayer-funded political appointee to perform personal tasks for himself and his wife, such as walking their dog.  Trump infuriated many members of Congress last May, including some fellow Republicans, by declaring a national emergency related to tensions with Iran in order to sidestep Congressional review and push ahead with $8 billion in military sales, mostly to Saudi Arabia.  The House and Senate both passed resolutions to block the sales. But Trump, a staunch promoter of both U.S. arms sales and the relationship with Saudi Arabia, vetoed them, and there was not enough support in the Republican-led Senate to override.  Menendez said he believed Linick was close to coming to a conclusion in his investigation of the arms sales.  \\\\u201cThere\\\\u2019s a lot here that the inspector general was obviously renewing and in the totality, it\\\\u2019s an alarming circumstance,\\\\u201d Menendez said on MSNBC.  Some Republicans also expressed concern.   Senator Chuck Grassley wrote to Trump and renewed his call for a detailed written explanation for terminating the inspectors general.  Representative Michael McCaul, top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs committee, was looking into the matter, a spokeswoman said.  \\\\u201cThe State Department Inspector General performs essential oversight of the department, so it raises questions when one is removed,\\\\u201d said Leslie Shedd, spokeswoman for the committee Republicans.  Trump replaced Linick with Stephen Akard, the official in charge of the Office of Foreign Missions who is considered a close ally of Vice President Mike Pence.  U.S. law allows a president to remove inspector generals, who act as watchdogs to expose waste or improper activities within government agencies.  Explaining Linick\\\\u2019s firing to Pelosi, Trump said only that he no longer had \\\\u201cfullest confidence\\\\u201d in Linick.

Barr added that the election should be decided strictly on policy debates, and that any investigation of a political candidate would need to be approved by him personally.  \\\\u201cWe cannot allow this process to be hijacked by efforts to drum up criminal investigations of either candidate,\\\\u201d Barr said.   Barr did not rule out the possibility of others being criminally investigated, without offering specifics.  Trump has not made clear what he is accusing Obama of doing, but the allegations appear to focus on law enforcement actions taken at the end of Obama\\\\u2019s presidency.  Special Counsel Robert Mueller concluded in March 2019 that Russians had actively tried to interfere in the 2016 presidential election, both through the hacking of the Democratic National Committee\\\\u2019s email system and through propaganda.  While his report documented numerous contacts between Trump\\\\u2019s campaign and Russia, he said there was not sufficient evidence to prove there was a criminal conspiracy.  Russia has repeatedly denied trying to influence the election and Trump has dismissed the idea as a hoax.  Barr has faced scathing criticism from Democrats and former career prosecutors in recent months who say he is the one who has politicized the justice system in favor of allies of Trump.  Earlier this month, Barr moved to dismiss the criminal charges against Trump\\\\u2019s former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who had already pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI.  In February he intervened to recommend a lighter sentence for Trump\\\\u2019s longtime friend Roger Stone.  Reporting by Sarah N.

Reporting by Jeff Mason and Steve Holland; Editing by Sandra Maler\",\"22\":\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Presumptive Democratic U.S. presidential nominee Joe Biden has been speaking regularly with former rival Elizabeth Warren on public health and economic relief ideas as he crafts more ambitious proposals aimed at helping Americans through the coronavirus crisis.  While Warren, a U.S. senator from Massachusetts and prominent voice on the Democratic Party\\\\u2019s left, criticized the former vice president\\\\u2019s approach on the campaign trail before dropping out and endorsing him, Biden advisers said the two see eye-to-eye on a number of issues.   In recent weeks, for example, Biden has endorsed Warren-backed ideas like canceling some student debt to help financially strapped Americans and echoed her calls for \\\\u201cstructural change\\\\u201d in an economy ravaged by the pandemic.  Biden is poised to challenge Republican President Donald Trump in the Nov. 3 election. Warren is thought to be on Biden\\\\u2019s short list of possible vice presidential running mates along with Senators Kamala Harris and Amy Klobuchar, among others. A decision is not expected for weeks.  Warren and Biden have held telephone conversations since she exited the Democratic race in March, and now talk nearly weekly, according to people familiar with their discussions who spoke on condition of anonymity. The focus, according to one of the people, has been on public health and economic relief policy around a pandemic that has driven tens millions of Americans into unemployment.  \\\\u201cLike Senator Warren, Joe Biden has been a champion for working families over corporations his entire career,\\\\u201d Biden spokesman TJ Ducklo said, accusing Trump of pursuing policies favoring corporations and political allies over working Americans.  Ducklo added that Biden is working with Warren and \\\\u201ca number of experienced voices\\\\u201d to create plans to resolve the crisis and get help to Americans those who need it most.  Warren\\\\u2019s office declined to comment on her conversations with Biden.  Biden has consulted other former rivals for the Democratic nomination including Washington state Governor Jay Inslee, while his team also seeks the support of policy groups on the left.  During the Democratic race, Warren chided Biden for holding high-dollar fundraisers and not embracing sufficiently sweeping economic change. But people close to Biden said he and Warren are more aligned ideologically than their public differences might suggest, particularly in their belief that the U.S. middle class has been eviscerated - even before the pandemic.  Biden\\\\u2019s campaign on Sunday released a video showing him and Warren calling small-dollar donors together to thank them for their support. At one point, Biden joked that he never had as many contributors to thank until Warren\\\\u2019s endorsement, a reference to her grassroots fundraising prowess.  \\\\u201cI\\\\u2019m counting on her a great deal - not just for her endorsement but for her ideas and her leadership,\\\\u201d Biden said.  Biden already has begun embracing some Warren positions. In addition to the student-debt proposal, he joined Warren and Harris in their calls for federal health officials to release more data on racial disparities in the pandemic\\\\u2019s impact on the U.S. population.  Biden and Warren this month co-authored an opinion piece in McClatchy newspapers demanding more oversight over trillions of dollars in federal coronavirus relief aid that they said included \\\\u201cgiveaways to the wealthy and big corporations.\\\\u201d   His rhetoric has shifted as well. Biden now talks about how the pandemic\\\\u2019s damage to the economy has created a \\\\u201cbig\\\\u201d opportunity for \\\\u201cstructural change,\\\\u201d echoing Warren\\\\u2019s campaign trail stump speech.  Last week, Biden said on his podcast that \\\\u201cwe need some revolutionary institutional changes,\\\\u201d a shift in language from when he said after his victory in the pivotal Feb. 29 South Carolina primary contest: \\\\u201cTalk about revolution isn\\\\u2019t changing anyone\\\\u2019s life.\\\\u201d  But Biden remains opposed to some Warren priorities such as her proposed Medicare for All government-run healthcare system or a wealth tax on billionaires.  Former President Barack Obama, under whom Biden served as vice president, last month praised Warren in the context of the pandemic, writing on Twitter that her proposals should serve as a model for policymakers. Biden and Obama speak regularly about his campaign.  \\\\u201cJoe Biden has more license now to go really big with bold systematic economic polices and not be accused of flip-flopping in any way, but instead be admired for meeting the moment,\\\\u201d said Adam Green, a co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, a policy advocacy group that backed Warren during the primary campaign.

The counteroffers from leading creditor groups, announced by Argentina\\\\u2019s government late Friday night, call for a shorter one-year grace period on payments and higher average interest rates than the government\\\\u2019s initial proposal, according to local media outlet Infobae.   Argentine over-the-counter bonds were up an average 3.3%,  traders said, while country risk fell 144 basis points to  2,693. The black market peso also strengthened to 128 per U.S. dollar, after falling to a historic low of 136 per dollar last week, double the official exchange rate.   Argentina, which is at risk of default on the bonds, proposed last month a tough restructuring that included a three-year payment halt, maturities pushed back until the next decade and a 62% reduction in coupon payments, an offer rejected by the majority of its creditors.   A joint counteroffer by firms Greylock, Gramercy and Fintech proposed a net present value of $58 for every $100 of current debt, an average interest rate of 5.03%, and a 2.3% lowered valuation, or haircut, on capital.   Another separate creditor group proposal, backed by BlackRock Financial Management, implies an average interest rate of 4.44%, a net present value of $60 per $100, and capital amortization starting in 2025.   A third offer proposed by firms including Monarch and BHK Capital included no haircut on capital and an average interest rate of 4.75% with capital amortization starting in 2027. It also included a net present value of $58 per $100.  A spokesman for Argentina\\\\u2019s Ministry of Economy declined to comment on the new counteroffers.  Buenos Aires province, meanwhile, was downgraded on Friday by ratings agency S&P Global to \\\\u201cSD\\\\u201d from \\\\u201cCC\\\\u201d after it missed the deadline for a bond payment of about $110 million.   The province had been deadlocked with its own creditors over the restructuring of $7 billion in foreign debts after they rejected its earlier proposal.

The share of mortgages in forbearance rose to 8.16% from 7.91% in the May 4-10 period, the industry lobbying group said, the smallest increase since March 16. The number of new requests for relief also fell relative to the prior week for the fifth consecutive survey period, the MBA said.  Ginnie Mae loans once again had the highest percentage of loans in forbearance by investor type, at 11.26% of loans. The share of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac loans in forbearance increased to 6.25% from 6.08%.  The U.S. economy has cratered since mid-March as many stay-at-home orders were enacted across the country to limit the spread of the virus. Job losses have continued to mount, with more than 30 million people newly thrown out of work, although a majority of states have now partially reopened commerce.  \\\\u201cWe will continue to closely monitor the forbearance request and call volume data for any sign of an uptick, but current trends suggest that if the economy continues to gradually reopen, the situation could be stabilizing,\\\\u201d said Mike Fratantoni, MBA\\\\u2019s senior vice president and chief economist.  As part of the $3 trillion financial relief package passed by Congress, borrowers with loans backed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae can get six months of forbearance if they have been impacted by the coronavirus outbreak, with a six-month extension possible. This covers 70% of the mortgage market.  Many banks and other lenders of non-agency mortgages are also allowing borrowers to enter into forbearance plans, usually for at least three months.

Waymo, a unit of Google\\\\u2019s parent Alphabet, started out focusing on autonomous taxis. It has also been developing autonomous trucks and delivery vehicles, and has signed deals with UPS and Walmart on automated delivery pilots. Waymo has branded its delivery operation as Waymo Via.   Now, Waymo has $3 billion in fresh capital after expanding its first funding round from outside investors with $750 million raised in mid-May.       Investors over the past seven months have pumped at least $6 billion into more than two dozen companies involved in autonomous delivery of goods and food, from drones to heavy trucks, according to a Reuters analysis.   The bulk of that investment - more than $4 billion since January - has flowed to big, late-stage companies such as Waymo and Didi Chuxing that are automating both ride and delivery services.   Automated sidewalk delivery robots have drawn lots of ink, but little recent investment. Still, more and more cities and companies are trying them out.  Christopher Bruno, head of the Fairfax, Virginia, economic development office, rushed to get Starship sidewalk robots on the street as soon as the coronavirus pandemic shut down the city.   \\\\u201cI think without a crisis, there would have been some skepticism as to whether this would have been used or not,\\\\u201d Bruno said. Formal approval for new businesses usually takes six to 10 months, he said, but \\\\u201cwe did it in a week and a half.\\\\u201d Now 20 robots in Fairfax are delivering meals, groceries, and hair products.  Early-stage investors are favoring heavy truck automation startups and companies that bundle hardware and software into a \\\\u201cfull stack.\\\\u201d  Autonomous trucking company TuSimple, which touts UPS as an investor, raised $215 million in September, bringing its valuation to over $1.2 billion, and is planning a new round of fundraising this year.  Some investors caution that pandemic-driven headlines are inflating expectations around automated delivery, which still faces technical and regulatory challenges.  \\\\u201cWhile there\\\\u2019s increased hype around automated delivery right now due to coronavirus, this health crisis will be mostly resolved in a few years from now before automated on-road delivery is ready for mass adoption,\\\\u201d said Quin Garcia, managing director of Autotech Ventures, an early investor in Lyft who is focusing his investments more on autonomous vehicles used in warehouses and on private land for farming and mining.  Still, automated delivery startups are trying to take advantage of a moment when the idea of human-free delivery is getting attention.  Refraction AI, an automated delivery startup in Ann Arbor, Michigan; Kiwibot, a sidewalk robot startup in Berkeley, California; self-driving tech company Optimus Ride in Boston; and Ireland-based Manna Drone Delivery are raising money as demand for their delivery services has jumped.

Farmers have killed off pigs and chickens as the pandemic shuts slaughterhouses and upends the food supply chain, leaving producers without markets for their animals, room to keep them or money to feed them.  Animal Place, a charity for unwanted farm animals, rescued the chickens over the weekend from an Iowa farm that was gassing some of its 140,000 birds because of the outbreak, Executive Director Kim Sturla said.   \\\\u201cIt is a bright spot,\\\\u201d she said. \\\\u201cThere\\\\u2019s so many struggling - human and non-human.\\\\u201d      Animal Place typically brings animals to its Northern California refuge by truck from within the state, but received a donation to extend its reach to the Midwest at a cost of tens of thousands of dollars, Sturla said.

Hoping to stop the bleeding of cash and restore investor confidence, the group also pooled businesses worth 6 billion euros ($6.6 billion) of sales and employing 20,000, about 13% of total staff, that are either to be sold or shut down.  \\\\u201cWith this reassessment of the portfolio, we have taken some difficult decisions that were long overdue and will now implement them systematically,\\\\u201d CEO Martina Merz said.  \\\\u201cThyssenkrupp will emerge smaller but stronger from the transformation.\\\\u201d  Three divisions \\\\u2014 Materials Services, Industrial Components and Automotive Technology \\\\u2014 will stay with Thyssenkrupp and be developed by the firm. Between them, these business account for 18 billion euros of sales, or 43% of the group\\\\u2019s total.  The move to not declare steel as a definite part of Thyssenkrupp\\\\u2019s future represents a deep cut in the firm\\\\u2019s history, which goes back more than 200 years and has been built on the metal.  For steel and marine systems, which builds submarines and frigates, Thyssenkrupp is pursuing a two-way approach meaning the businesses could be developed with partners remaining in the group, confirming what sources told Reuters earlier.  Shares in Thyssenkrupp, which have lost nearly two-thirds of their value over the past 12 months after a raft of profit warnings and dwindling investor confidence, closed 12.5% higher as a result.  The announcement also accelerates Thyssenkrupp\\\\u2019s dismantling, a process that started last year when the group had to abort a plan to form a steel joint venture with Tata Steel (TISC.NS) and instead sell its crown jewel: elevators.  Sources had told Reuters that contact between Thyssenkrupp and Tata Steel never broke off and that both were still in talks about consolidation.  Business paper Handelsblatt said that Thyssenkrupp was also in discussions with Sweden\\\\u2019s SSAB (SSABa.ST) and China\\\\u2019s Baoshan Iron & Steel (Baosteel) (600019.SS) and that both were interested in a majority of the German firm\\\\u2019s steel unit.

Juergen Kerner, deputy chairman of Thyssenkrupp\\\\u2019s supervisory board and a key figure at powerful labour union IG Metall, said any consolidation in steel had to be explored under Thyssenkrupp\\\\u2019s leadership.  \\\\u201cWe reject a holding that operates like a layman in various markets and only serves as a junior partner in the industrial core business that is steel,\\\\u201d he said. IG Metall said it favoured a German consolidation with Salzgitter (SZGG.DE).  The Alfried Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach Foundation, Thyssenkrupp\\\\u2019s top shareholder with a 21% stake, came out in support of the plans, adding it continued to believe in the group\\\\u2019s potential. \\\\u201cThyssenkrupp has no time to lose,\\\\u201d it said.  Swedish fund Cevian, the No.2 shareholder, said the announcement was an important step for the firm. \\\\u201cIt is now crucial that this plan is implemented with urgency and decisiveness,\\\\u201d founding partner Lars Foerberg said.  Thyssenkrupp said that a new unit called Multi-Tracks would house those units that led to 400 million euros of cash outflows last year and whose future would be outside the group.

Yemen has been mired in violence since the Western-backed coalition intervened in March 2015 against the Houthis, who say they are fighting a corrupt system.  The United Nations\\\\u2019 Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) said hunger could spread drastically due to the pandemic.   \\\\u201cThat situation could be really catastrophic if all the elements of worst case scenarios come to be but let\\\\u2019s hope not and the U.N. are working on avoiding that,\\\\u201d senior FAO regional official Abdessalam Ould Ahmed told Reuters.   Reporting by Mohammed Ghobari, Additional reporting by Maha El Dahan in Dubai; Writing by Ghaida Ghantous; Editing by Angus MacSwan and Giles Elgood\",\"37\":\"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico\\\\u2019s president on Monday slammed criticism of new rules giving the state more control over electricity production, likening the private sector to colonial plunderers and lashing out at prominent international media as stooges of big business.  Responding to business groups\\\\u2019 complaints that the new regulations to govern power supply threatened old contracts, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said he was leveling a playing field previously beholden to private interests.  \\\\u201cIf we don\\\\u2019t put things in order, things will stay the same,\\\\u201d Lopez Obrador told a regular news briefing. \\\\u201cThey\\\\u2019ll continue seeing Mexico as a land of conquest. As they did. Foreign companies came to plunder.\\\\u201d  \\\\u201cThey plundered more during the neo-liberal period than they did in three centuries of colonial domination,\\\\u201d the veteran leftist added, referring to the 36 years of \\\\u201cneo-liberal\\\\u201d rule he says preceded his presidency, which began in December 2018.  Lopez Obrador has pledged to revive heavily-indebted state oil firm Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex) and national power company the Comision Federal de Electricidad (CFE) as part of his plan to bolster the public sector\\\\u2019s role in the energy sector.  In order to help the two state-owned companies, Lopez Obrador has walked back parts of the liberalization of the energy market undertaken by the previous government.  That process has caused repeated friction with business groups and foreign allies, which view his inclination to revisit contracts signed under previous governments as a violation of the law and Mexico\\\\u2019s international treaty commitments.  Shrugging off threats by businesses to take the government to court over the rule changes, Lopez Obrador said they could try. He accused them of being upset that he was thwarting their plans to carve up the energy market among themselves.  \\\\u201cAnd they were conspiring to destroy Pemex and the Comision Federal de Electricidad,\\\\u201d he said.  The European Union and Canada on Friday raised concerns about the moves in letters to Energy Minister Rocio Nahle, pointing to an April 29 order that suspended the operation of new renewable plants on the grounds that the government needed to safeguard power supply during the coronavirus outbreak.  Then, late on Friday, the energy ministry published rules that give the government more scope to control the approval of new renewable energy projects, sparking an angry response from several of Mexico\\\\u2019s top business associations.  Nahle said on Monday morning she would respond to Canada and the European Union this week.  Business groups believe the law is on their side, pointing to some court decisions that have gone in their favor in various ongoing energy-related disputes with the administration.  Lopez Obrador, whose poll ratings have improved during the past few weeks, charged that his detractors were using the international media to attack him.  \\\\u201cBecause their disinformation efforts in the Mexican press aren\\\\u2019t working, they\\\\u2019ve gone to newspapers from other parts of the world,\\\\u201d he told the briefing, citing papers such as The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times and The Washington Post.  The newspapers mentioned, along with other media, have offered critical appraisal of his administration, which has so far failed to meet targets he set for increasing economic growth and reducing record levels of violence plaguing the country.  \\\\u201cSo what characterizes these newspapers, speaking frankly?\\\\u201d he continued. \\\\u201cThey have also been taken by the big international, economic and financial corporations.\\\\u201d  Reporting by Dave Graham; Additional reporting by Ana Isabel Martinez and Raul Cortes; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama, Paul Simao, and Aurora Ellis\",\"38\":\"WARREN, Michigan (Reuters) - The Detroit Three automakers and their suppliers began restarting assembly lines on Monday after a two-month coronavirus lockdown in a slow revival of a sector that employs nearly 1 million people in the United States.  On a chilly and damp Monday morning, hundreds of workers at Fiat Chrysler Automobile\\\\u2019s (FCA) (FCHA.MI) truck plant in Warren, Michigan began lining up before 4 a.m. to start the 5 a.m. shift. Signs overhead read: \\\\u201cLet\\\\u2019s restart.\\\\u201d  \\\\u201cI\\\\u2019m a little nervous,\\\\u201d said Larry Smith, 53, of New Baltimore, who works on wheel alignment away from the assembly line. \\\\u201cThey made all the precautions (and) they\\\\u2019ve done everything they can to prepare us ... I\\\\u2019m trusting in God.\\\\u201d  Detroit automakers on Monday said there were no issues with absenteeism as the plants opened.  FCA reopened four U.S. assembly plants on Monday, including Warren Truck, on a single shift, as well as four parts plants.  The reopening of car plants will be a closely watched test of whether workers across a range of U.S. industries can return to factories in large numbers without a resurgence of infections.   General Motors Co (GM.N), Ford Motor Co (F.N) and FCA have all been preparing for weeks to reopen their North American factories in a push to restart work in an industry that accounts for about 6% of U.S. economic activity.  Investors welcomed the gradual restart, sending GM\\\\u2019s shares up more than 9% on Monday. FCA shares rose 7.3%, while Ford\\\\u2019s were up 6.7%.  Auto companies have redesigned assembly lines and retrained workers in an effort to avoid coronavirus outbreaks that could derail production again.   Workers entering factories on Monday were checked by temperature monitors. Face masks or shields are standard protective equipment. Jobs such as installing seat belts that used to require two or more workers to get close together inside a vehicle have been redesigned to keep people a safe distance apart.   Plastic screens have been installed along assembly lines to separate workers leaning in to the engine compartments of vehicles. Break areas have been reconfigured to keep workers six feet apart.   The Detroit automakers have collaborated with each other and with the United Auto Workers to develop common coronavirus safety practices. Other automakers in the United States are adopting similar safety measures.   Wearing a black Detroit vs Everybody face mask as he entered FCA\\\\u2019s Warren Truck plant early Monday, production operator Laruante Gary, a Detroit resident who installs doors on Ram pickups, said, \\\\u201cI expect to see things cleaned and safety protocols being observed, and I expect us to know something as far as the next steps for us.\\\\u201d  Another production worker at the plant, Sean Reid, 37, of Belleville, expressed concern over the earlier virus-related deaths of several U.S. auto workers, including one at Warren Truck.  \\\\u201cI don\\\\u2019t know where people have been, I don\\\\u2019t know what they\\\\u2019ve been doing,\\\\u201d he said. \\\\u201cI don\\\\u2019t like it, but what can I do, really?\\\\u201d  The Detroit automakers have many older workers in states such as Michigan that were hit hard by the pandemic.  Theresa Segura, 61, of Lincoln Park, arrived for work at the FCA Warren plant on Monday but was immediately sent home after noting on an FCA questionnaire that she had been exposed to a family member who had just tested positive for the virus.  Segura, who has worked at the truck plant since 1993, said she thought that it was in any case too soon to reopen \\\\u201cbecause there are still people sick out there.\\\\u201d  \\\\u201cWe\\\\u2019re risking our lives going in there,\\\\u201d said Segura, who works as a \\\\u201cfloater,\\\\u201d moving from job to job at the plant as needed.       Some non-union automakers in the southern United States reopened earlier this month. Electric car maker Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) began building vehicles last week in defiance of a shutdown order in Alameda County, California, then stopped and agreed to reopen again Monday.  For the automakers and their suppliers, many of which began reopening their plants last week, the restart is critical to ending the cash drain caused by a two-month shutdown forced on them by COVID-19.   The emphasis is on getting assembly lines again producing such profitable vehicles as GM\\\\u2019s Chevrolet Suburban SUV, Ford\\\\u2019s F-150 pickup truck and FCA\\\\u2019s Jeep Wrangler SUV.  \\\\u201cUltimately we\\\\u2019re in this together. Because if we don\\\\u2019t build trucks, Ford Motor Company is gone,\\\\u201d said Todd Dunn, president of UAW Local 862, the union that represents more than 14,000 hourly workers at Ford\\\\u2019s two Kentucky assembly plants, which build trucks and SUVs.  The UAW\\\\u2019s Dunn said one question will be how many Ford workers punch in at his local production facilities this week given a lack of daycare in Kentucky, where schools are closed, as well as fear among those with underlying health conditions who are at greater risk. Ford has been hiring temporary workers to cover absenteeism, he said.  President Donald Trump on Thursday will tour a Ford manufacturing plant in Michigan that has been repurposed to make ventilators and personal protective equipment, according to the White House.      GM is reopening a number of plants on one shift, including 1,600 hourly workers making pickup trucks in Flint, Michigan, and 1,600 workers manufacturing pickups in Fort Wayne, Indiana.  Another issue automakers will have to watch closely is the financial health of suppliers. As most suppliers get paid on average 45 days after they deliver parts, some will struggle to stay afloat as the industry slowly reopens, analysts say.

But Russia, whose tally of 290,678 cases is the second highest after the United States, said the situation remained difficult after officials reported 8,926 new infections.  This marked the third day in a row that the figure was below the 10,000 mark which it has been above for most of this month.  Meanwhile, Moscow is working on securing supplies of reciprocal medical aid from the United States to help it combat the coronavirus, Russia\\\\u2019s Deputy Foreign Sergei Ryabkov said.  U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that Washington was sending Moscow some testing equipment and medical ventilators to help it manage the crisis and that the equipment was \\\\u201con its way\\\\u201d, the Washington Examiner reported on Sunday.    Although Russia sent a batch of Russian-made medical ventilators to the United States in early April, U.S. officials say they were not needed in the end.     Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin, who was diagnosed with the coronavirus last month, told a televised government meeting on Monday that the situation overall was improving and that many patients were being discharged by hospitals.  \\\\u201cThe situation ... remains difficult, but we can nonetheless say we have managed to stop the growth in the infection (rate),\\\\u201d he said at the meeting held by video conference. \\\\u201cThe dynamic is positive, according to the most cautious estimates.\\\\u201d  Moscow and Russian regions across 11 time zones are in their eighth and seventh week of a lockdown respectively to curb the spread of the coronavirus, but Mishustin said that 27 regions were safe to begin gradually relaxing their restrictions.   He did not specify which regions this applied to.  Russia\\\\u2019s coronavirus taskforce said on Monday that 91 people had died in the last 24 hours, pushing the country\\\\u2019s death toll to 2,722 as Moscow looked to the United States for help.  Ryabkov said on Monday that U.S. President Donald Trump had promised earlier that the United States would be ready to help Russia with equipment once it was mass producing ventilators.   \\\\u201cThat possibility was welcomed with gratitude from our side, this issue is now being worked on. We consider mutual help to be a straight-forward matter,\\\\u201d Ryabkov was quoted by Russia\\\\u2019s RIA news agency as saying.  The ventilator that Russia sent to the U.S., the Aventa-M, came under the spotlight last week after it was reported to have caused two hospital fires, in Moscow and St Petersburg.   Russia subsequently suspended the use of the Aventa-M, although only those manufactured from April 1, after the ventilators had been sent to the United States.

Madrid last week surprised its European Union partners by  imposing a two-week quarantine on all overseas travellers and effectively keeping its borders closed, saying it wanted to avoid a second wave of COVID-19.  But the move was meant to be temporary and Transport Minister Jose Luis Abalos said it would be phased out in parallel with travel being allowed within Spain.  \\\\u201cWe can\\\\u2019t allow foreigners to travel while the Spanish population is confined,\\\\u201d he told broadcaster TVE. \\\\u201cFrom late June, we\\\\u2019ll start tourism activity, I hope ... We must make Spain an attractive country from the health point of view.\\\\u201d  Tourism accounts for over 12% of Spain\\\\u2019s economic output. Even with borders reopening in late June, the industry\\\\u2019s revenues will fall by 93 to 124 billion euros ($100 to $134 billion), lobby group Exceltur estimates.  Spain registered 59 deaths overnight from the coronavirus, the second day the number has been below 100 and the lowest in two months, the health ministry said.   The cumulative death toll rose to 27,709, while cases rose to 231,606 on Monday from 231,350 the previous day.   \\\\u201cToday\\\\u2019s data are really good compared to what we\\\\u2019ve seen so far,\\\\u201d Health Emergency Chief Fernando Simon told reporters.  Simon said the mortality rate had decreased from around 11% during the late March peak in Spain to less than 2% for those who developed symptoms between April 27 and May 3.   Encouraged by the statistics, Spain is slowly easing a strict lockdown in place since mid-March that even stopped people from going outside for exercise.  The Health Ministry said on Monday it would expand the use of face masks, currently obligatory on public transport. People must now wear masks in closed spaces and in public if it is not possible to guarantee the minimum safe distance of two metres.   Restaurants and bars were gradually reopening - even though staff knew customers would be scarce.  In the Mediterranean city of Valencia, restaurant manager Cristina Gonzalo and her staff were out early preparing their beachside bar. Dressed in a white shirt and matching mask, a waiter painstakingly measured out space between tables to  comply with social-distancing requirements.  Gonzalo said she had doubts about reopening but was happy to  help staff, who had been furloughed under the government\\\\u2019s temporary layoff program.  \\\\u201cThey did not receive money to shop for essentials and they were desperate,\\\\u201d she said.  But in a sign many outlets may not survive, football superfan Manolo Caceres - famed for banging a big drum in support of Spain at 10 World Cups - told Reuters he was facing bankruptcy after being forced to close his Valencia bar.  \\\\u201cI\\\\u2019ve lost everything,\\\\u201d said Caceres, 71, known affectionately as \\\\u201cManolo el del Bombo\\\\u201d (Manolo with the drum).  \\\\u201cI want to sell my World Cup drum because I don\\\\u2019t have enough money to eat,\\\\u201d he added, explaining his 800 euro monthly pension barely covered his mortgage.

The British-run region last week laid out a five-stage plan for easing the lockdown similar to Ireland\\\\u2019s, but its omission of any dates for action raised the chances of different parts of the island reopening at different times.  The United Kingdom\\\\u2019s constituent parts of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have taken a more conservative approach than England after Prime Minister Boris Johnson encouraged some people to return to work last week.

In a 2017 report, Reuters detailed here how Semlex, which supplies passports to various African countries, won the contract.  The deal greatly increased the price citizens have to pay for passports, and documents showed a Gulf company owned by a relative of Congo\\\\u2019s then-president received almost a third of the revenues.

The number of new confirmed cases of the virus rose by 492, or 0.3%, the ministry said, as fears of a second wave of infections linger in France, where junior high schools are now reopening their doors in some regions.  On Sunday it had seen only 120 new coronavirus cases, or a daily increase of 0.1%.  The number of people in intensive care with COVID-19 infection declined by 4.3% to 1,998, below the 2,000 threshold for the first time since March 22. The number of people in hospitals fell to 19,015 from 19,361 on Sunday.  Both numbers - key indicators for the French health system\\\\u2019s ability to cope with the epidemic - have been on a downtrend for four to five weeks and peaked at more than 32,000 and more than 7,000 respectively in early to mid-April.

Under the new rules, buses, taxis and three-wheelers will return to the streets but with restrictions. Buses will not carry more than 20 passengers, each of whom will be screened before boarding, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said.  \\\\u201cCorona will stay, and we will also survive,\\\\u201d Kejriwal said, outlining the new guidelines for the city of 20 million people that has one of highest numbers of coronavirus cases in the country.  However, a factory of the Chinese smartphone maker OPPO near Delhi suspended operations after six workers tested positive for the coronavirus.  The factory had received government permission to resume limited production as part of a gradual relaxation of the shutdown that began on March 25.  But when OPPO tested workers prior to the restart, six  tested positive for COVID-19, said Deep Chandra, senior official at the Greater Noida Industrial Development Authority.  OPPO said in a statement that operations at the plant were suspended and it would only allow employees with negative test results to resume work.  The southern state of Karnataka, home to technology hub Bengaluru, also lifted some restrictions on the movement of trains, taxis and buses within the state. Transportion from outside the state will remain suspended except for essential services.  Experts say that coronavirus cases will rise in coming weeks as India\\\\u2019s lockdown is eased, and authorities have repeatedly told companies resuming operations to ensure that social distancing and other measures are taken to prevent infections.  India has seen a rapid rise in coronavirus infections in recent days, with confirmed cases at around 96,000 and more than 3,000 deaths, according to federal data.  On Sunday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi\\\\u2019s government extended the nationwide lockdown to May 31, but relaxed rules in areas with lower numbers of cases and allowed state governments to issue their own guidelines on some matters.  With the restrictions eased, some traffic poured back onto the roads of the capital, and hairdressers, beauty parlours, stationary shops, and butchers were among the small businesses reopening elsewhere in the country.  But schools, malls and other public places will remain mostly closed, and large gatherings are still prohibited.  Compounding the challenges for the country, hundreds of millions of migrant workers have been stranded across India for weeks, unable to return home after authorities banned all transport services in late March.  After a series of road and rail accidents, where dozens of workers died, authorities are now increasing efforts to help them home.  In the southern city of Chennai, construction worker M.D. Rustom queued along with hundreds of others for a bus and train trip back to the eastern state of Bihar, some 2,000 km away.  \\\\u201cWe don\\\\u2019t have money to eat,\\\\u201d he said. \\\\u201cIt has been over 50 days, we just want to go back now.

Developing economies\\\\u2019 assets were especially hard hit by a deep market sell-off in March and face rising borrowing costs.  That makes it more challenging for them to fund a stimulus spree on the scale of those by major governments, with interest rates near record lows, that are pumping trillions into their ailing economies.  How well-placed local debt markets across developing nations are to absorb heavy government debt issuance depends on factors such as domestic pension funds and insurance companies, the presence of local commercial banks and the buying power of central banks, Goldman Sachs said in a note.  \\\\u201cA key question is whether local markets are equipped to absorb the additional issuance if foreign portfolio investment is constrained or whether this will cause further increases in bond premia and renewed upward pressure on yields,\\\\u201d Goldman Sachs\\\\u2019 Kamakshya Trivedi wrote.  Brazil faced a \\\\u201cmedium-to-high risk\\\\u201d from a potential surge in local government debt, he said.   \\\\u201cAlthough local markets are liquid relative to peers, it is highly likely that the local banking sector (both commercial banks and the central bank) will eventually have to increase their purchases to counterbalance the high bond supply and the foreign outflows driven by the low FX (forex) carry,\\\\u201d Trivedi said.   Over the medium to long term, risks could escalate without meaningful fiscal adjustments, he said, adding the weakness of the currency over the last few months was a warning of domestic investors\\\\u2019 low confidence in local assets.  Brazil\\'s real BRL= has been the worst performer among emerging markets. The currency has weakened by around 30% against the U.S. dollar since the start of the year.   Frontier markets - a subset of smaller and riskier emerging economies - faced a high risk from any local sovereign debt surge because of their relatively small number of institutional investors, relatively small banking sectors and because their central banks need to preserve foreign asset buffers to prevent pressures on the currencies.  The lack of a private sector counterweight to mop up a possible debt splurge means support from the official sector was likely to be inevitable, Trivedi said, adding he would also put Turkey in this group.  Turkey\\'s lira TRY= fell to fresh record lows in early May although it has recovered since. Still, since the start of the year it has lost 14% against the dollar.

The show at the Scuderie del Quirinale Gallery opened on March 5 but closed just three days later as COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the new coronavirus, spread across Italy.  It had been due to finish on June 2, but its organisers said in a statement on Monday they had reached an agreement with museums around the world, including Madrid\\\\u2019s Prado, London\\\\u2019s National Gallery and the Washington National Gallery of Art, to extend the loans of their masterpieces for three months.  Raffaello Sanzio da Urbino, known in the English-speaking world as Raphael, was born in 1483 and died aged just 37 after a sudden illness in Rome. He was one of the most celebrated artists of his age.  \\\\u201cThe exhibition offers the opportunity to admire a concentration of Raphael works that we have never seen in the same venue,\\\\u201d said Eike Schmidt, director of Florence\\\\u2019s Uffizi museum.  \\\\u201cWe are very happy to extend the loan of about 50 masterpieces for as long as necessary\\\\u201d, he added.  During the lockdown the artworks have been covered up but the exhibition has never been dismantled because the curators had hoped for a restart.  Some 70,000 tickets had been sold in online sales before the first opening to the public, for an exhibition that brings together 204 works of art, including 120 by Raphael himself.  As the number of daily COVID-19 cases and deaths decreases the government is relaxing lockdown restrictions imposed to curb the spread of the virus. However,t social distancing rules remain quite stringent and only a very few people at a time will be admitted to the show.

Within a week, the drone company was testing out an entirely different concept - delivering medication and critical supplies to isolated elderly people whom the Irish government had told to stay home to avoid infection.  Manna worked with Ireland\\\\u2019s health service operator to try out the system in Moneygall, the small midlands town best known for its ancestral links to former U.S. President Barack Obama, who visited in 2011.  After weeks of flying to and from residents\\\\u2019 homes, the local pharmacy and convenience store - located at the Barack Obama Plaza motorway service station - Manna says it has proved the technology works.   \\\\u201cWe wanted to do something small but meaningful that would be representative of what the future might look like either in an extended lockdown or a repeated lockdown in the future,\\\\u201d Manna Aero chief executive and founder Bobby Healy told Reuters.  \\\\u201cLong term, we know that the future is going to have drone delivery. This helps with hearts and minds around how important, how safe and how practical autonomous delivery is going to be while at the same time genuinely helping a small town under really difficult circumstances.\\\\u201d   Manna, which counts Peter Thiel\\\\u2019s Founders Fund, an early Facebook backer, among its investors, will continue the deliveries on a non-commercial basis and could cover around 600 towns of similar size around the country by the end of the year if the government wishes, Healy said.  With one drone capable of making 100 4-kilogramme deliveries a day, that could involve not only the 450 licensed drone pilots in Ireland but also some of the many pilots Ryanair and IAG-owned Aer Lingus have said they plan to let go as a result of the coronavirus disruption.  In Moneygall, locals are running a dedicated phone line rather than a mobile phone application so vulnerable residents like Fidelma Gleeson, 70, can order bread and milk, and have her prescription medicines brought to the door.  \\\\u201cWell it means an awful lot to me.

Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva told Reuters she was not pushing countries to seek suspension of debt payments from official bilateral creditors, but wanted them to have the option to free up funds to fight the new coronavirus pandemic.  The G20 in April backed the debt relief proposal championed by Georgieva and World Bank President David Malpass, and a group of private creditors recommend their members participate, but interest has been tepid.  Of 77 countries that are eligible for such debt relief, only 22 have requested forbearance thus far, an IMF spokesman said.  The Paris Club of creditor nations on Monday said it had agreed to suspend debt service payments from Mali and the Caribbean island of Dominica as part of the G20 debt relief deal, the first two countries to benefit.  Pakistan\\\\u2019s de facto Finance Minister Abdul Hafiz Shaikh said in early May that Islamabad had also applied for debt relief offered by the G20, and would seek to defer a payment of around $1.8 billion for Pakistan for one year.  Kenya\\\\u2019s finance minister on Friday said his country would not seek a suspension of debt payments because the terms of the deal were too restrictive, and he was concerned about the effect debt relief might have on Kenya\\\\u2019s credit rating.  The program was intended to ease the economic impact of the pandemic on the world\\\\u2019s poorest countries, many of which lack good health system and have high debt levels.  However, the terms of the G20 debt relief also limit the amount of non-concessional debt that countries can raise during the suspension period, potentially curbing access to capital markets.  The World Health Organization has warned COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the new coronavirus, could infect between 29 million and 44 million people in Africa this year if it is not contained, meaning already weak healthcare systems could be overwhelmed. Food security is another concern given devastation caused by swarms of locusts in eastern Africa.  But emerging market asset managers working with heavily-indebted African countries have argued that blanket debt relief by private creditors would put African countries\\\\u2019 access to capital at risk.  Georgieva said the leaders of some eligible countries had written to her expressing concerns, but did not name any. She said it was a sovereign decision whether countries participated.  \\\\u201cI actually would not urge countries to participate in debt relief initiatives if they think it is in their best interest not to participate,\\\\u201d she told Reuters in an interview.  \\\\u201cWe make it possible,\\\\u00a0and then countries have to assess the pro and cons of participation. For some countries, the concern is that if they were to go for debt relief, that may impact their credit rating and access to markets.\\\\u201d  Georgieva acknowledged there had also been no demand thus far for a new short-term liquidity line set up by the IMF this month. She said she was not surprised given that it was intended for the best performing countries and only offered 145% of a country\\\\u2019s quota with the Fund.  Peru and Chile had opted to tap the IMF\\\\u2019s precautionary Flexible Credit Line instead, she said, giving them access to larger amounts of money, but could segue later to the new short-term instrument.  \\\\u201cMy interest was to make sure the Fund has everything that can help countries, and it was very clear that we were lacking an instrument that doesn\\\\u2019t lock in a big chunk of Fund resources for a long period of time,\\\\u201d she said. \\\\u201cSooner or later there will be usage.\\\\u201d  Reporting by Andrea Shalal; additional reporting by Karin Strohecker in London and Leigh Thomas in Paris; Editing by David Gregorio and Tom Brown\",\"55\":\"MADRID (Reuters) - Spain\\\\u2019s Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez welcomed a 500 billion euro ($543 billion) Recovery Fund proposed by France and Germany on Monday to help regions and sectors hardest hit by the coronavirus.   \\\\u201cIt is a first step in the right direction,\\\\u201d Sanchez wrote on Twitter, adding it was an initiative in line with Spain\\\\u2019s demands that \\\\u201cwe should keep advancing\\\\u201d.

But the WHO\\\\u2019s chief critic, the U.S. administration of President Donald Trump, decried an \\\\u201capparent attempt to conceal this outbreak by at least one member state\\\\u201d.  Trump has already suspended U.S. funding for the WHO after accusing it of being too China-centric, and at the same time led international criticism of Beijing\\\\u2019s perceived lack of transparency in the early stages of the crisis.  Health Secretary Alex Azar did not mention China by name, but made clear Washington considered the WHO jointly responsible.  \\\\u201cWe must be frank about one of the primary reasons this outbreak spun out of control,\\\\u201d he said. \\\\u201cThere was a failure by this organization to obtain the information that the world needed, and that failure cost many lives.\\\\u201d   Speaking after Azar, Chinese Health Minister Ma Xiaowei said Beijing had been timely and open in announcing the outbreak and sharing the virus\\\\u2019s full gene sequence, and urged countries to \\\\u201coppose rumours, stigmatisation and discrimination\\\\u201d.  Chinese President Xi Jinping pledged $2 billion over the next two years to help deal with COVID-19, especially in developing countries.  The amount almost matches the WHO\\\\u2019s entire annual programme budget for last year, and more than compensates for Trump\\\\u2019s freeze of U.S. payments worth about $400 million a year.  But White House National Security Council spokesman John Ullyot called it \\\\u201ca token to distract from calls from a growing number of nations demanding accountability for the Chinese government\\\\u2019s failure to ... warn the world of what was coming\\\\u201d.    WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the U.N. body had \\\\u201csounded the alarm early, and we sounded it often\\\\u201d.  When it declared a global emergency on Jan. 30, there were fewer than 100 cases outside China, and no deaths, he said.  He was addressing a virtual meeting of the WHO\\\\u2019s decision-making body, the World Health Assembly, at which Xi said China had acted with \\\\u201copenness and transparency and responsibility\\\\u201d.      Tedros, who has always promised a review, told the forum it would come \\\\u201cat the earliest appropriate moment\\\\u201d and make recommendations for the future. He received robust backing from the WHO\\\\u2019s independent oversight panel.   \\\\u201cEvery country and every organisation must examine its response and learn from its experience,\\\\u201d he said, adding that the review must cover \\\\u201call actors in good faith\\\\u201d.  In its first report on the handling of the pandemic, the seven-member oversight committee said the WHO had \\\\u201cdemonstrated leadership and made important progress in its COVID-19 response\\\\u201d.  The panel endorsed a review but said conducting it now could hamper the WHO\\\\u2019s response to the pandemic.  It also said \\\\u201can imperfect and evolving understanding\\\\u201d was not unusual when a new disease emerged and, in an apparent rejoinder to Trump, said a \\\\u201crising politicization of pandemic response\\\\u201d was hindering the effort to defeat the virus.  Azar said the United States supported \\\\u201can independent review of every aspect of WHO\\\\u2019s response\\\\u201d and that China\\\\u2019s conduct should be \\\\u201con the table\\\\u201d too.  A resolution drafted by the European Union calling for an independent evaluation of the WHO\\\\u2019s performance appeared to have won consensus backing among the WHO\\\\u2019s 194 states. It was expected to be debated and adopted on Tuesday.  German Health Minister Jens Spahn said the WHO must become \\\\u201cmore independent from external interference\\\\u201d and that its role in \\\\u201cleading and coordination\\\\u201d must be strengthened.  China has previously opposed calls for a review of the origin and spread of the coronavirus, but Xi signalled that Beijing would accept an impartial evaluation of the global response, once the pandemic is brought under control.  \\\\u201cThis work needs a scientific and professional attitude, and needs to be led by the WHO,\\\\u201d he told the meeting via video.  The WHO and most experts say the virus is likely to have emerged in a market selling wildlife in the central city of Wuhan late last year. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said this month there was \\\\u201csignificant\\\\u201d evidence that it had come from a laboratory in Wuhan, a charge China rejects.  Australian health minister Gregory Hunt said the planned review could look at strengthening the WHO\\\\u2019s mandate and powers of inspection, and also how to protect against \\\\u201cthe global threat posed by wildlife and wet markets\\\\u201d.  The oversight panel said that, for the next phase of the pandemic, the WHO would need some $1.7 billion by the end of the year, leaving a funding shortfall of $1.3 billion. This did not take account of China\\\\u2019s pledge.  China will also make any COVID-19 vaccines that it develops freely available, Xi said.

Almost 32,000 Italians have died of COVID-19 since the outbreak came to light on Feb. 21, the third-highest death toll in the world after the United States and Britain.   Italy was the first European country to impose nationwide restrictions in early March, only permitting an initial relaxation of the rules on May 4, when it allowed factories and parks to reopen.  Monday marked a major step forward on the road to recovery, with unlimited travel allowed in individual regions, friends once again meeting up and restaurants able to serve as long as tables were at least 2 metres (6.5 ft) apart.   Telephones rang incessantly in hairdresser salons, as unkempt clients rushed to make themselves more presentable.  \\\\u201cI already have 150 appointments, all very urgent, all of them insisting that they must be first on the list,\\\\u201d said Stefania Ziggiotto, a hairdresser in the Alpine resort of Courmayeur. \\\\u201cI have a full agenda for three weeks.\\\\u201d  However, many business owners worried that the reopening might not magic away their many problems, with lingering fears of the coronavirus keeping many Italians at home, while foreign tourists, vital for the economy, were utterly absent.

Monica Robaldo, owner of the Pierre Alexis 1877 restaurant in Courmayeur, said she would not reopen before the end of May.  \\\\u201cWe have a loyal clientele ... mostly tourists, so while travel between the regions and from abroad is not allowed, there is not much point in reopening,\\\\u201d she said.  The Treasury is predicting the economy will contract by at least 8% in 2020, the deepest recession since World War Two, and Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said at the weekend he was taking a \\\\u201ccalculated risk\\\\u201d in rolling back the rigid curbs.  Although there was noticeably more traffic on the roads of major cities on Monday morning, some people appeared hesitant to resume their old habits.  Angelo Lombardo, owner of Cocco Caffe in the northern city of Bologna, is allowed to serve a maximum four customers at any one time, but he said he wasn\\\\u2019t having to worry about social distancing rules at present.  \\\\u201cA lot of people are just walking past and looking in from outside wondering whether they can come in or not,\\\\u201d he said, criticising the government for doing too little to explain how the rules had changed.  \\\\u201cLet\\\\u2019s give it time,\\\\u201d he said. \\\\u201cIt\\\\u2019s the first day.\\\\u201d  Reporting by Crispian Balmer, Giulio Piovaccari; Stephen Jewkes and Gabriele Pileri; Editing by Nick Macfie\",\"58\":\"LONDON (Reuters) - A chorus of comments from top officials at the Bank of England about negative interest rates has revived talk that the British central bank might resort to cutting borrowing costs below zero to cushion the economy from the coronavirus shutdown.  The BoE has cut rates twice as the COVID-19 crisis escalated in March to a record low of 0.1%.  Most economists say its next move will be to add to the firepower of its 645 billion-pound ($783 billion) bond-buying programme as soon as June 18, at the end of its next scheduled meeting.  But investors on Monday began to price in the possibility of the BoE overcoming its long-standing reluctance to take rates below zero from the end of 2020 as it contemplates what could be the biggest economic slump in three centuries.  The shift in markets came after the BoE\\\\u2019s chief economist, Andy Haldane, said the central bank was looking more urgently at negative interest rates as well as at buying riskier assets.   \\\\u201cThe economy is weaker than a year ago and we are now at the effective lower bound, so in that sense it\\\\u2019s something we\\\\u2019ll need to look at \\\\u2013 are looking at \\\\u2013 with somewhat greater immediacy,\\\\u201d Haldane told the Daily Telegraph newspaper in an interview published late on Saturday.   \\\\u201cHow could we not be?\\\\u201d  On Monday, rate-setter Silvana Tenreyro talked up the benefits of negative rates, citing the experience of other countries in Europe.  \\\\u201cMy personal view, which comes from the reading of the European experiences, is that negative rates have had a positive effect in the sense of having a fairly powerful transmission to real activity,\\\\u201d she told a London School of Economics webinar.  The comments from Tenreyro and Haldane, the latter one of the BoE\\\\u2019s most outspoken policy-makers, struck a more urgent note than the message from Governor Andrew Bailey.  Last week, Bailey said taking rates below zero \\\\u201cis not something we are currently planning for or contemplating\\\\u201d, but he added it was not wise to rule anything out.  Allan Monks, an economist with JP Morgan, said the comments, along with Deputy Governor Ben Broadbent\\\\u2019s saying on May 12 the BoE needed to keep on weighing up the pros and cons of negative rates, suggested the central bank was reviewing its stance.  \\\\u201cDespite the mixed messaging, it appears the MPC (Monetary Policy Committee) believes this is a debate which is at least worth revisiting,\\\\u201d Monks said in an email to clients.  The departure in March of previous governor Mark Carney, who was particularly resistant to going negative, might have created space for fresh discussions, he said.  While the European Central and the Bank of Japan have cut their benchmark rates below zero in a bid to get banks to turn their cash into loans and boost economic growth, the BoE has said it believes such a move would be counterproductive, because it would hurt banks and make them less likely to lend.  But investors have not missed the apparent willingness to contemplate the question anew.  Rob Wood, an economist with BofA Global Research, said the brevity of the recent comments allowed for misunderstandings, but the BoE seemed to be signalling that 0.1% was no longer the floor for rates, and a cut to zero was possible in August.  \\\\u201cWe think a policy rate of 0% is easier for the BoE to contemplate and they will need to exhaust other options, which will take time, before taking rates negative,\\\\u201d Wood said.  Going below zero would further weaken sterling, which is already touching two-month lows against the dollar and the euro because of the prospect of failure in London\\\\u2019s post-Brexit trade talks with Brussels.   But saying never to sub-zero borrowing costs no longer made sense, Wood said.  \\\\u201cWe see the probability of negative rates higher for 2021 than 2020,\\\\u201d he said. \\\\u201cWe can\\\\u2019t rule it out anymore.\\\\u201d  Writing by William Schomberg, editing by Larry King and Giles Elgood\",\"59\":\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Medical diagnostic firm PerkinElmer Inc faces a federal investigation into its role in an alleged Medicare fraud involving tens of thousands of unnecessary genetic cancer tests, according to three sources with knowledge of the probe and documents reviewed by Reuters.  The firm conducted the tests now under scrutiny over 18 months, earning millions of dollars, according to one of those sources and three others familiar with the company\\\\u2019s lab operations.  Investigators are probing whether Massachusetts-based PerkinElmer enabled a scheme by some its laboratory clients, two of which the government previously has charged in connection with alleged Medicare fraud, said the three sources with knowledge of the probe.  PerkinElmer ran high volumes of tests for those clients. Investigators are focused on whether the firm knew - or should have known - that the tests were not medically necessary and that its clients were billing them to the government program for the elderly and disabled, those three sources said.  Such tests determine if patients are at risk of developing hereditary diseases, such as breast or colorectal cancer. Medicare covers the screenings if a patient\\\\u2019s physician deems them necessary, often because of a personal or family history of hereditary cancers.  The tests sent to PerkinElmer raised red flags among some company employees because the patients often didn\\\\u2019t fit the typical profile for testing and few results showed a cancer risk, according to the three sources familiar with the company\\\\u2019s operations.  A spokeswoman for PerkinElmer, Fara Goldberg, did not answer detailed questions from Reuters but said in a statement that the company was not aware of any fraud or abusive practice by PerkinElmer or any employee, and that it had \\\\u201cnot been notified of any actual or alleged wrongdoing by any government authority.\\\\u201d  The company said it supports government efforts to identify and prevent abuse in genetic testing, and that it would cooperate with such efforts \\\\u201cas appropriate.\\\\u201d  Madhuri Hegde, a chief scientist for the company\\\\u2019s genetic testing unit, is also under investigation because of her role in establishing business relationships with the lab clients charged in the Medicare fraud schemes, according to two people familiar with the probe and records of the investigation reviewed by Reuters.  Hegde, in an email to Reuters, she said denies \\\\u201cany wrongdoing whatsoever.\\\\u201d   PerkinElmer is a leading medical diagnostic company that sells laboratory equipment and performs testing in such areas as food, the environment and neonatal genetics. Genetic testing represents only a fraction of the company\\\\u2019s diagnostic sales, which it reported as $1.14 billion for 2019. It is currently competing with other diagnostic firms to develop and sell new tests to detect the new coronavirus amid the pandemic. It received emergency authorization in March from the Food and Drug Administration to start selling its test for COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus.  The PerkinElmer inquiry is part of a broader Medicare fraud investigation unveiled by the Justice Department in September, saying it had charged 35 people accused of bilking Medicare out of about $2.1 billion. The probe was featured in a Reuters special report last fall, which explored how senior citizens were duped into providing cheek swabs to companies that billed Medicare for useless genetic tests.  The probe is being conducted jointly by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Health and Human Services Office of the inspector General, and the three sources familiar with the investigation said it includes PerkinElmer.  Justice Department criminal division spokesman Peter Carr declined to comment on whether PerkinElmer is under investigation. Katherine Harris, a spokeswoman for the Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector General, also declined to comment.  Two businessmen \\\\u2013 each of whom founded two labs that later outsourced genetic cancer tests to PerkinElmer \\\\u2013 were criminally charged last fall in connection with the alleged genetic testing fraud.  One of the companies, Atlanta-based LabSolutions LLC, started doing business with PerkinElmer in late 2017, according to the three people familiar with the companies\\\\u2019 dealings.  LabSolutions purchased equipment and servicing agreements and outsourced its genetic cancer testing to PerkinElmer until it could set up its own labs, according to one of the sources familiar with the probe and the documents reviewed by Reuters.  LabSolutions owner Minal Patel was indicted in September on charges of healthcare fraud and paying and receiving kickbacks to and from marketers who collected cheek swabs from patients for genetic testing.   Patel, who has pleaded not guilty, did not reply to a message seeking comment. His lawyer, Steven Sadow declined to comment except to say he would \\\\u201caggressively\\\\u201d defend his client.  LabSolutions has ceased business operations. Don Samuel - a lawyer the company retained to handle government asset seizures related to the criminal case - declined to comment.  In January 2018, Hegde became a LabSolutions Scientific Advisory Board consultant for a $5,000 monthly retainer plus $500 per hour to help set up LabSolutions operations, according to documents reviewed by Reuters. She remained on PerkinElmer\\\\u2019s payroll at the same time. Reuters could not determine whether PerkinElmer was aware of Hegde\\\\u2019s consulting for LabSolutions or whether the government is investigating the arrangement.  PerkinElmer and Hegde did not comment on the consulting work.  In November 2019, another PerkinElmer client - Personalized Genomics\\\\u2019 operator Ravitej Reddy - was charged by the Justice Department for allegedly conspiring to pay and receive kickbacks to and from business consultants, a telemedicine company and marketers who provided the cheek swabs for genetic testing as part of a Medicare fraud scheme.  Reddy pleaded guilty in January and is due to be sentenced in September. Mark Rush, who represents Reddy and both labs, said Reddy accepts full responsibility for his actions in the scheme.  The Justice Department said in November that Personalized Genomics and a second lab Reddy operated in Monroeville, Pennsylvania - Med Health Services Management, LP - did not have \\\\u201cproperly validated equipment\\\\u201d and were forced to send samples for genetic tests to another laboratory. That lab was PerkinElmer, according to the sources familiar with company operations.  PerkinElmer performed about 1,500 genetic cancers tests per week at times in 2018 and 2019, said the three people familiar with the lab\\\\u2019s operations.  PerkinElmer charged its lab clients as much as $450-$550 per test during the 18-month period that is now under federal scrutiny, according to company pricing data obtained in the government\\\\u2019s investigation and reviewed by Reuters. Although the company\\\\u2019s genetic testing unit is relatively small, its revenue growth quadrupled to $20 million between 2017 and 2019, company executives said in earnings calls.  The three sources familiar with PerkinElmer\\\\u2019s testing operations said that the company\\\\u2019s Connecticut lab, which ran all of the genetic tests, was inundated with what one source called \\\\u201cbags and bags\\\\u201d of samples, forcing staff to work overtime.  The bulk deliveries raised concerns among some employees that some clients seemed to be in business solely to collect samples from patients and bill the government for tests performed by PerkinElmer, according to one source familiar with the PerkinElmer\\\\u2019s testing operations.  Most of the cheek swabs sent for testing came from senior citizens, even though some of the leading inherited cancers are more common in younger adults. And one of the sources familiar with PerkinElmer\\\\u2019s testing said \\\\u201calmost all\\\\u201d of the results showed patients were not at risk of developing these cancers.

The U.S. special representative for Afghanistan, Zalmay Khalilzad, left one day after Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and his rival Abdullah Abdullah signed a power-sharing deal that could help lead to peace talks to end the country\\\\u2019s long-running war.  The three main impediments to the start of intra-Afghan negotiations, which were to begin March 10, have been a rise in violence, the pace of prisoner releases and the failure of Ghani and Abdullah to resolve a power struggle.  While in Doha, Khalilzad will meet with Taliban officials to discuss carrying out a Feb. 29 U.S.-Taliban agreement that called for prisoner releases by both sides and to \\\\u201cpress for steps necessary to commence intra-Afghan negotiations, including a significant reduction of violence,\\\\u201d the State Department said.  In Kabul, Khalilzad will meet with senior government officials \\\\u201cto explore steps the Afghan government needs to take to make intra-Afghan negotiations begin as soon as possible,\\\\u201d it added.  The key provisions of the Feb. 29 agreement - to which the Afghan government was not a party - involved a U.S. commitment to reduce its presence in Afghanistan to 8,600 troops by mid-July and, conditions permitting, to zero by May 2021.

Proceeds could be used for working capital and acquisitions, the company said.     Uber and Grubhub this month were haggling over a stock exchange ratio, and there was no certainty that they will reach an agreement.

Siding with hundreds of people hurt and relatives of people killed in the bombings, the justices ruled 8-0 to throw out a lower court\\\\u2019s 2017 decision that had freed Sudan from punitive damages awarded in the litigation in addition to about $6 billion in compensatory damages. Justice Brett Kavanaugh did not participate in the case.   The case hinged on the Supreme Court\\\\u2019s view of a 2008 amendment to a federal law known as the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act allowing for punitive damages. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in 2017 upheld Sudan\\\\u2019s liability but ruled that the amendment was made after the bombings occurred and could not be applied retroactively.  Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote in Monday\\\\u2019s ruling that for claims made under federal law, \\\\u201cCongress was as clear as it could have been when it authorized plaintiffs to seek and win punitive damages for past conduct.\\\\u201d   The ruling also ordered the D.C. Circuit to reconsider its decision that the foreign plaintiffs who sued Sudan under state law in the United States also could not seek punitive damages.   Starting in 2001, groups of plaintiffs sued in federal court in Washington under the 1976 Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, which generally bars claims against foreign countries except those designated by the United States as state sponsors of terrorism - as Sudan was in 1993. A federal judge found Sudan liable and awarded the plaintiffs $10.2 billion, including $4.3 in punitive damages.   Sudan has faced a deepening economic crisis since the 2019 overthrow of its longtime ruler Omar al-Bashir.  President Donald Trump\\\\u2019s administration had urged the justices to side with the plaintiffs who sued Sudan.  Twelve Americans were killed in the Aug. 7, 1998, attacks. The lawsuits involve 567 people, mostly non-U.S. citizens who were employees of the U.S. government and their relatives.   The damages had been imposed by default because for most of the litigation Sudan did not appear before a lower court to counter accusations that it harbored and provided support to the Islamist militant group al Qaeda. Sudan denied the allegations.  The truck bombs that detonated outside the embassies in Nairobi, Kenya and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania marked the first large-scale al Qaeda attack.  Reporting by Andrew Chung; Editing by Will Dunham\",\"63\":\"(Reuters) - When COVID-19 began tearing through Detroit\\\\u2019s county jail system in March, authorities had no diagnostic tests to gauge its spread. But the toll became clear as deaths mounted. First, one of the sheriff\\\\u2019s jail commanders died; then, a deputy in a medical unit.  \\\\u201cWorking in the Wayne County Jail has now become a DEATH sentence!\\\\u201d the head of the deputy sheriffs\\\\u2019 union, Reginald Crawford, wrote on Facebook as the losses mounted.  By mid-April, the jail system\\\\u2019s medical director and one of its doctors also had died from COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. The virus was everywhere, but jail officials had little sense of who was infected and spreading it.  Testing of inmates and staff \\\\u2013 needed to determine who should be quarantined to slow transmission \\\\u2013 was just getting started. In the weeks since, more than 200 staff and inmates have tested positive.  COVID-19 has spread rapidly behind bars in Detroit and across the nation, according to an analysis of data gathered by Reuters from 20 county jail systems, 10 state prison systems and the U.S. Bureau of Prisons, which runs federal penitentiaries.  But scant testing and inconsistent reporting from state and local authorities have frustrated efforts to track or contain its spread, particularly in local jails. And figures compiled by the U.S. government appear to undercount the number of infections dramatically in correctional settings, Reuters found.  In a May 6 report, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention surveyed 54 state and territorial health departments for data on confirmed COVID-19 infections in all correctional facilities \\\\u2013 local jails, state prisons and federal prisons and detention centers. Thirty-seven of those agencies provided data between April 22-28, reporting just under 5,000 inmate cases.  Reuters documented well over three times the CDC\\\\u2019s tally of COVID-19 infections \\\\u2013 about 17,300 \\\\u2013 in its far more modest survey of local, state and federal corrections facilities conducted about two weeks later. The Reuters survey encompassed jails and prisons holding only 13% of the more than 2 million people behind bars nationwide. Among state prisons doing mass testing of all inmates, Reuters found, some are seeing infection rates up to 65%.  The CDC tally \\\\u201cis dramatically low,\\\\u201d said Aaron Littman, a teaching fellow specializing in prison law and policy at the law school of the University of California, Los Angeles. \\\\u201cWe don\\\\u2019t have a particularly good handle\\\\u201d on COVID-19 infections in many correctional and detention facilities, \\\\u201cand in some places we have no handle at all.\\\\u201d  Problems with unreliable data aren\\\\u2019t unique to corrections. Epidemiologists say the incidence of COVID-19 in the general U.S. population also is unclear due to limited testing, especially in the pandemic\\\\u2019s early days. And the CDC acknowledged in its report that its infection count for jails and prisons was similarly hampered by spotty data and \\\\u201cnot representative\\\\u201d of the disease\\\\u2019s true prevalence in those facilities.  But uneven testing for COVID-19 in correctional settings and erratic reporting of confirmed cases have profound implications for health officials and policy makers tracking its spread, because epidemiologists see jails and prisons as key pathways of transmission.  The United States has more people behind bars than any other nation, a total incarcerated population of more than 2.2 million as of 2018, including nearly 1.5 million in state and federal prisons and just under 740,000 in local jails, according to the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics.  Jails generally keep inmates for short stays: arrestees awaiting trial or people serving short sentences. The churn of these inmates raises the risk of infections among both the inmates themselves and jail staff, who can carry the virus to and from the community.  Prisons, which hold convicted criminals on longer sentences, also are fertile ground for the virus. While inmates come and go far less frequently, the pathogen can be carried in from the community by a single contagious staffer, spread quickly in crowded cell blocks, and be re-introduced to the community by other, newly infected workers.  Reuters collected data from 37 state prison facilities across the country that have done mass testing for COVID-19 among all inmates, including those with no symptoms, and found more than 10,000 confirmed cases among the 44,000 tested. There were 91 deaths from the disease at those facilities, which span 10 states.  In contrast, federal prisons, which typically limit testing to inmates with obvious symptoms, reported confirmed infections in fewer than 4,200 of their total inmate population of about 150,000, with 52 deaths.  The situation in the nation\\\\u2019s 2,800 local jails is even more opaque. Many don\\\\u2019t report their COVID-19 cases publicly, and there is no national tracking of their infection numbers.  Reuters surveyed the 20 U.S. counties with the largest jails, holding an average total of about 73,000 inmates, and found nearly 2,700 confirmed COVID-19 cases \\\\u2013 a figure that has risen nearly 30-fold over the past six weeks. While some of that increase is a result of increased testing during that time, it still reflects an almost certain undercount, because testing remains limited in many of those facilities.  The surge in jail infections comes amid a chorus of concerns from judges, oversight agencies, corrections officers, defense lawyers and civil rights groups that most local lockups are ill-equipped to control the virus, which has killed at least 310,600 people worldwide. Unlike state and federal prisons, typically equipped to provide health care for long-term inmates, jails often have little medical capacity.  In health care, jail inmates \\\\u201care the last and the least and the lost,\\\\u201d said Dr. Thomas Pangburn, chief medical officer for Wellpath LLC, the medical contractor in Wayne County\\\\u2019s jails and hundreds of others nationwide. Many jails have been overlooked in the race to secure COVID-19 test kits and medical supplies for hospitals and nursing homes, he said, but \\\\u201cwe have the most vulnerable population in a very confined space meant for correctional housing \\\\u2013 and not for medical care.\\\\u201d  In many jails and prisons, the toll of COVID-19 on corrections officers and other staff approaches that of inmates \\\\u2013 and here, too, the numbers reported to the CDC by state and local authorities appear to be a vast undercount.  The CDC report documented nearly 2,800 COVID-19 cases among staff across all U.S. correctional facilities. But Reuters found more than 80% of that number \\\\u2013 upwards of 2,300 infected jail and prison workers \\\\u2013 in its far less comprehensive survey of just the federal prison system, a few dozen state prisons and the 20 counties with the biggest local jails.  In an effort to curb infection rates, many jails and prisons are releasing inmates to create more distance among those remaining behind bars. That has raised concerns about whether inmates, particularly in jails, are being screened for COVID-19 before returning to the community, where many can\\\\u2019t get medical care.  More than 37,000 state and federal prisoners have been released since March 31, according to U.S. government data and records collected from 41 state prison systems by the Vera Institute of Justice, a research group that seeks to reduce incarcerated populations. There is no national tracking of local jail releases, but in just the 20 counties surveyed by Reuters, at least 14,000 jail inmates have been let go.  Releasing inmates is critical \\\\u201cboth in jails and surrounding communities, because of the role jails serve as vectors\\\\u201d for spreading the virus, said Udi Ofer, justice division director at the American Civil Liberties Union, which has filed dozens of \\\\u201cdecarceration\\\\u201d suits and legal petitions. \\\\u201cIt\\\\u2019s a crisis.\\\\u201d  Some groups have pushed back. Victims\\\\u2019 rights group Marsy\\\\u2019s Law, named after the murdered sister of billionaire Henry Nicholas, has criticized the releases, expressing concern that crime victims aren\\\\u2019t always notified when inmates are let out.  U.S. President Donald Trump declared the COVID-19 pandemic a national emergency on March 13. By that time, officials in the Wayne County Sheriff\\\\u2019s Office already were scrambling to address a looming outbreak in their three jails.  Days earlier, Sheriff Benny Napoleon and Chief Robert Dunlap, the jails supervisor, had laid plans to keep inmates more separated, cut public visits and quarantine new arrivals \\\\u2013 rules that took effect just after Trump\\\\u2019s announcement. On March 19, the jail also began releasing low-level offenders, for the most part inmates with risky medical conditions.  Staff and inmates were already falling ill across the jail system, which typically houses a population of about 1,400. Donafay Collins, 63, a jail commander, was hospitalized with a COVID-19 infection that would kill him less than two weeks later \\\\u2013 the first death among the four staffers claimed by the virus.  \\\\u201cIt\\\\u2019s like a bad dream,\\\\u201d Chief Dunlap said in an interview with Reuters.  Meanwhile, getting diagnostic tests and protective equipment to track and manage the virus proved challenging, Dunlap said. Suppliers had little to offer, and just about everything they had was going to hospitals and emergency medical services.  Hunting for face masks, the sheriff\\\\u2019s office turned to Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, who had been pressing the federal government to give states more supplies from federal stockpiles. On March 20, state officials sent the sheriff 7,500 N-95 masks provided by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.  The highly protective masks are used by staff handling sick inmates, Dunlap said. Basic surgical masks became available later for more routine use by both staff and inmates, he added.  Getting test kits proved even harder. As COVID-19 raced through Wayne County\\\\u2019s jails in March, corrections officers needing tests had to visit a local testing center or hospital, where they often were refused if they did not show specific symptoms, Dunlap said. It wasn\\\\u2019t until April 6 \\\\u2013 the day the virus killed the jails\\\\u2019 medical director, Dr. Angelo Patsalis \\\\u2013 that officers began getting regular tests through the Wayne State University Physician Group.  Getting the tests was \\\\u201ca matter of life and death,\\\\u201d said Crawford, the head of the deputy sheriffs\\\\u2019 union, in an interview.  For inmates, however, testing remained elusive.  In late March, the sheriff directed the jail\\\\u2019s medical contractor, Wellpath, to obtain test kits for inmates, but the company couldn\\\\u2019t get enough due to heavy demand, Dunlap said. \\\\u201cWellpath, like every other provider around this county, couldn\\\\u2019t get them.\\\\u201d So, COVID-19 testing was limited to inmates with symptoms.  By April 30, the jail\\\\u2019s population had dropped to just 834 inmates \\\\u2013 about 500 had been released \\\\u2013 and only 89 had been tested for the new coronavirus. Of those tested, 29 were positive, just over 30%, according to the sheriff\\\\u2019s office. Among the sheriff\\\\u2019s 810-member staff, 196 had tested positive, or 23% \\\\u2013 of whom 89 have returned to work.  On May 7, the jail expanded testing to all inmates under a grant from the Hudson Webber Foundation. That should \\\\u201cfurther mitigate the spread of the virus\\\\u201d inside and outside the jail, Dunlap  said, and help identify infected inmates before release.  As in many states, Michigan\\\\u2019s prison system began universal testing earlier than the jails.  On April 21, Michigan\\\\u2019s Department of Corrections began testing for coronavirus infections in large numbers of inmates even if they showed no sign of illness, said department spokesman Chris Gautz.  Demands for mass testing are growing. The ACLU and the Council of Prison Locals, representing 30,000 federal prison employees, called earlier this month for universal testing in all federal lockups.  But some public health experts are ambivalent on that approach. The CDC\\\\u2019s guidance for correctional facilities calls for quick COVID-19 testing of inmates who appear symptomatic, but it takes no position on universal testing.  The guidance reflects a belief among some public health experts that testing only symptomatic inmates and, in some scenarios, a sample of the rest may suffice for assessing the virus\\\\u2019 overall prevalence in a jail or prison, said Marc Stern, former medical director for the Washington State prison system and a faculty member at the University of Washington School of Public Health. Testing every asymptomatic inmate may not make sense if a jail lacks the capacity to isolate and trace the contacts of those who test positive \\\\u2013 and also because not everyone who tests positive may be contagious.  In Michigan\\\\u2019s prison system, however, officials say mass testing has been valuable.  \\\\u201cIf you don\\\\u2019t know where the problem is, you can\\\\u2019t fix it,\\\\u201d spokesman Gautz said.  Charles Peterson, 78, began showing symptoms of COVID-19 a week after a parole violation landed him in Colorado\\\\u2019s Weld County Jail on March 11. By the time he was released on March 30, he was on the verge of dying from it.  Peterson declined quickly, two fellow inmates told Reuters. Coughing and disoriented, they said, he eventually struggled to stand and began losing control of his bladder and bowels.  Donovan Birch said he and other inmates alerted jail staff, but Peterson was left in the general population. Birch also became ill with COVID-19 symptoms after his exposure to Peterson, he said, but never was tested.  Peterson \\\\u201cneeded help,\\\\u201d said Birch, who was jailed on a parole violation for trespassing charges. \\\\u201cI knew he was going to die if he didn\\\\u2019t get it.\\\\u201d  Instead, Peterson was released; two days later, he was dead. Official cause: \\\\u201cacute respiratory failure, viral pneumonia and COVID-19 infection.\\\\u201d  Peterson likely was a \\\\u201csuperspreader,\\\\u201d according to an infectious disease expert who inspected the jail on behalf of inmates for a lawsuit they filed seeking better sanitary and safety measures. By early May, at least 10 of the jail\\\\u2019s roughly 480 inmates had tested positive for the virus \\\\u2013 but just 22 had been tested. Eighteen deputies had also been infected, the jail said.  The inmates\\\\u2019 lawsuit claims Weld County Sheriff Steven Reams \\\\u201cwillfully disregarded public health guidelines\\\\u201d by leaving three to four inmates to a cell, sharing sinks and toilets, as the virus spread. \\\\u201cFailing to prevent and mitigate the spread of COVID-19 endangers not only those within the institution,\\\\u201d the suit says, \\\\u201cbut the entire community.\\\\u201d Reams declined to comment.  The case is among more than 100 lawsuits nationwide, many of them class-action cases, seeking mass releases of inmates or other measures to reduce overcrowding and infection risks in jails hit by the new coronavirus, according to the UCLA law school\\\\u2019s COVID-19 Behind Bars Data Project. Many of those cases, as well as hundreds more filed by individual inmates, argue that confinement in facilities with COVID-19 outbreaks violates the U.S. Constitution\\\\u2019s protections against cruel and unusual punishment.  Inmates have been issued masks since early April and have access to soap, hand sanitizer and cleaning supplies, said Weld County Sheriff\\\\u2019s spokesman Joe Moylan. He noted the jail has been on lockdown since April 1 \\\\u2013 the day Peterson died \\\\u2013 and inmates are rotated out of their cells in small groups to common areas that allow for social distancing. He declined to comment on the litigation and the specific cases of Peterson and Birch.  Peterson was released after Colorado\\\\u2019s Department of Corrections decided not to hold him for his parole violation, part of the effort to slow COVID-19 transmission in local jails by reducing inmate populations. Since March 1, the jail has reduced its population by more than 300 inmates; fewer than half its 954 beds are occupied.  Peterson\\\\u2019s parole violation involved failing to renew his sex offender registration while living at \\\\u201cRock Found,\\\\u201d a re-entry home for convicts returning to the community. When he was let out of jail, a former Rock Found roommate brought him back to the home, cold, shivering, barely able to walk.  The program director called paramedics.  \\\\u201cI honestly could not believe that not a single person from the Weld County Jail had told anyone at Rock Found that they were releasing a seriously sick person into our care,\\\\u201d the director, Cheryl Cook, said in a statement filed in the inmates\\\\u2019 lawsuit.  Moylan, the sheriff\\\\u2019s spokesman, said Peterson was not tested for COVID-19 because he was not overtly symptomatic.  The conditions at the jail violated the constitutional rights of medically vulnerable inmates, a federal judge ruled May 11. He ordered the sheriff to socially distance those at risk, provide single cells when possible, and improve cleaning of communal spaces.   Many of the problems addressed by the judge were identified by the plaintiffs\\\\u2019 expert witness during two visits to the jail in April. He reported to the court that he found most inmates confined to group cells more than 22 hours a day with no handwashing options unless they were let out to a bathroom. Many complained of unsanitary conditions and said shared sinks and toilets were not cleaned between uses, the expert reported.  Ralph Brewer, 41, jailed for violating a restraining order, told Reuters he was directed to continue working in the kitchen after developing nausea and a bad cough. Staffing was short, he was told, so he had to work unless he had a fever.  \\\\u201cIt really concerned me. We had no masks, just gloves,\\\\u201d Brewer said. He requested a doctor to check his lungs, he said, but nurses only gave him Tylenol, cough medicine and instructions to stay hydrated.  Brewer was released on April 3 and his daughter took him straight to an urgent care clinic. The doctor said he had COVID-19 symptoms \\\\u2013 no tests were available \\\\u2013 and told him to quarantine for 14 days, Brewer said. He recovered at his mother\\\\u2019s house.  \\\\u201cI was lucky to get out, but I\\\\u2019m worried about the people still in jail,\\\\u201d Brewer said. \\\\u201cIt\\\\u2019s crazy in there.\\\\u201d      (This story corrects name in second paragraph)      Additional reporting and data analysis by Grant Smith.

Overall, the measures are expected to generate $1 billion in annual cost savings compared with pre-pandemic budget plans.   Uber employed 28,600 people before the pandemic crippled its business, according to a regulatory filing at the end of the first quarter. The company\\\\u2019s initial wave of 3,700 layoffs affected less-costly customer support and recruiting teams, while Monday\\\\u2019s announcement affects 3,000 employees across nearly all departments.  Smaller U.S. rival Lyft Inc (LYFT.O) said late last month it would cut about 17% of its workforce.  Khosrowshahi said Uber must establish itself as a self-sustaining enterprise no longer in need of outside capital, calling the company\\\\u2019s food delivery business Uber Eats the \\\\u201cnext enormous growth opportunity.\\\\u201d  Before the pandemic struck, Uber said it would become profitable on the basis of adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization by the end of this year. The company withdrew that guidance as global stay-at-home orders to curb the virus pummeled its ride-hailing business.  Ride-hailing trips, which generate the bulk of Uber\\\\u2019s revenue, dropped 80% globally in April, but the company said demand was slowly recovering.  Uber on May 7 said it was now aiming to become profitable on an adjusted basis at some point in 2021, partially thanks to an uptick in restaurant food order deliveries.  Khosrowshahi on Monday called Uber Eats a silver lining during the crisis and said be believes the currently loss-making unit would one day be profitable.  Demand for Uber Eats jumped 50% in the first quarter, but the unit still lost $313 million on an adjusted EBITDA basis.  Uber is currently in talks to buy food delivery rival GrubHub Inc (GRUB.N) to expand its market share.       Uber has been working on various other businesses, including the development of self-driving cars and a freight logistics network. Khosrowshahi did not directly mention these businesses in his email and a spokesman declined to comment beyond the email.  His email said Uber would close its startup incubator program and artificial intelligence research lab. Uber was also looking at strategic alternatives for Uber Works, a platform Uber launched in October to help companies fill staffing gaps  with temporary workers during peak demand.  Khosrowshahi also said the company was closing or consolidating some 45 office locations globally as part of the restructuring.

Lawyers in an insurance dispute in Collin County District Court on Monday picked a jury to hear the case by videoconference, in what officials believe is the first virtual jury trial to be held nationally amid the COVID-19 crisis.  More than two dozen potential jurors logged in by smartphone, laptop and tablet for jury selection, which was streamed live on YouTube here with a judge occasionally providing tech advice on how to best use their devices.  The one-day trial is a so-called summary jury trial, in which jurors hear a condensed version of a case and deliver a non-binding verdict.  The parties, having seen how their case could fare before a jury in a full-blown trial, will sit down for mediation and try to negotiate a settlement on Tuesday.  Officials say the abbreviated format and non-binding verdict make it ideal to test the viability of holding jury trials remotely, as they grapple with the more daunting challenge of how to conduct them safely in person during the pandemic.  \\\\u201cYou can\\\\u2019t drag people down to the courthouse and make them sit together for days at a time,\\\\u201d Texas Supreme Court Chief Justice Nathan Hecht said in an interview. \\\\u201cIt\\\\u2019s just too dangerous.\\\\u201d  Courts throughout the country have since March curtailed operations and limited in-person court hearings as states adopted stay-at-home orders and ordered businesses closed to slow the spread of the coronavirus.  In 39 states and the District of Columbia, court systems on a statewide basis directed or encouraged judges to conduct hearings remotely by phone or videoconference, according to the National Center for State Courts. But jury trials came to a halt.  Monday\\\\u2019s case, a lawsuit accusing the insurer State Farm of failing to honor its obligations to cover property damage to a building caused by a 2017 storm, was originally set to go to trial in McKinney, Texas, in March.  Even as courts in many states draw up plans to resume operations, judges and court officials have questioned how to safely conduct in-person trial proceedings.  Ideas include spreading jurors out in a courtroom and requiring them and lawyers to wear masks. Even with these precautions, it is not clear how hundreds of people can be asked to show up for jury duty in cramped courthouses.  \\\\u201cIt\\\\u2019s just imponderable,\\\\u201d Hecht said. \\\\u201cThere are hundreds of people over the country studying how do we get back to jury trials.\\\\u201d  The Indiana Supreme Court said last week that once jury trials resume in the state, parties in civil cases can agree to conduct them remotely. And in Arizona, the state\\\\u2019s top court has said it will allow jurors to be selected remotely.  The moves come as courts face a growing backlog of cases. In 2019, Texas held an average of 186 jury trials per week, said David Slayton, the Texas Office of Court Administration\\\\u2019s administrative director.  Whether virtual trials will be successful remains to be seen.   Judge Emily Miskel, whose courthouse is overseeing Monday\\\\u2019s trial, said the case could illuminate whether a \\\\u201chybrid approach\\\\u201d is possible, in which jury selection is virtual and the remainder of the trial is conducted in person.  Slayton acknowledged that holding trials remotely presents challenges, including making sure jurors remain attentive and do not conduct research online. But those issues also exist with in-person trials and can be easily dealt with by a warning from the judge, he said.  \\\\u201cObviously it\\\\u2019s on video, so the judge can tell if jurors are washing dishes or doing something else,\\\\u201d Slayton said.

The surplus is 14.56% wider than in the same period of 2019 despite the crisis caused by the novel coronavirus, which has disrupted transport systems worldwide, said ATP, which represents Brazilian private-sector terminal operators including miner Vale (VALE3.SA) and grain merchant Bunge (BG.N).  The widened surplus reflects the fact that Brazilian ports have operated regularly amid the pandemic, ATP said in a statement. The result comes amid a 30% drop in maritime freight prices following the global oil rout, ATP President Murillo Barbosa said in a separate statement.  Brazil\\\\u2019s growing maritime trade surplus underscores the strength of the country\\\\u2019s farm sector, which exported higher amounts of goods like soybeans in March and April driven by strong Chinese demand.  Brazil shipped some 36 million tonnes of the oilseeds through April, according to data from maritime agency Cargonave on Brazil\\\\u2019s top export commodity. This corresponds to half of the volume of soy the country sold in the whole of 2019, Cargonave data show.  ATP said the maritime trade balance calculation involves only cargo moved by sea, largely mineral and agriculture commodities.   By value, Brazilian maritime imports dropped by almost 7% from January to April, compared to the same period a year ago, while maritime exports were virtually stable at $56.75 billion, ATP said, based on government data.  By volume, Brazil\\\\u2019s maritime exports were also relatively stable at 195.6 million tonnes while imports increased 1.09% in the first four months of 2020, ATP said, also using official trade data.   The rise in imported volumes was mainly driven by a rise in fertilizer purchases as fertilizer prices drop, according a proprietary ATP analysis.

Watiya air base, 125 km (80 miles) from the capital, has been an important strategic foothold for forces loyal to eastern-based commander Khalifa Haftar, who launched an offensive to capture Tripoli in April 2019.  The campaign sharply escalated a long-running conflict between factions based in eastern and western Libya and caused a surge in military intervention by foreign powers.  Forces aligned with the Government of National Accord (GNA) had taken full control of Watiya, Osama Juweili, a top military commander, was quoted as saying by official media early on Monday.  Footage posted by GNA forces on social media showed them driving down runways at the base unhindered. The forces also posted a picture of what they said was a captured Russian-made Pantsir air defence system mounted on a truck at the base, as well as an operating manual in Arabic.  A separate video post showed the purported destruction from the air of another Pantsir held by Haftar\\\\u2019s Libyan National Army (LNA) as it was being transported by road in the early hours of Monday.   GNA forces said it was the third they had hit in two days. The video could not be independently verified and the LNA has in recent days denied at least one other GNA claim it had destroyed a Pantsir.   In a statement, the LNA said its forces had withdrawn from the base as a tactical manoeuvre, that Watiya currently held no military importance, and that any equipment recovered there was old and disused. LNA sources said earlier their forces had withdrawn after the base had come under intensive bombardment.  GNA forces have pushed back against their rivals in recent weeks with increased support from Turkey, capturing towns on the coast west of Tripoli last month.  Haftar\\\\u2019s LNA and its allies still control eastern and southern Libya, including most of the country\\\\u2019s oil facilities, which they have been blockading since January. They also hold Sirte, a city at the centrepoint of Libya\\\\u2019s Mediterranean coastline, which they took at the start of the year.  The capture of Watiya will further boost morale among GNA forces that were on the back foot late last year, and GNA Prime Minister Fayez Serraj signalled they would try to build on the advance.     \\\\u201cToday\\\\u2019s victory does not constitute the end of the battle but brings us closer than any time before to the bigger victory, the liberation of all towns and regions and bases,\\\\u201d he said in a statement.   The LNA, which is backed by the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, and Russia, has been unable to make significant progress from the outskirts of Tripoli since early on in its campaign.  It lost Gharyan, its main forward base south of Tripoli, in its biggest reversal to date in June 2019, but continues to control Tarhouna, southeast of the capital.  International efforts led by the United Nations to broker a ceasefire and negotiate a political settlement in Libya have so far come to little, as foreign powers have flouted an arms embargo to send in more weapons and operate drones.  The leaders of Turkey and Russia, countries that have both sought to protect strategic interests in Libya, spoke by phone on Monday and noted the need for a ceasefire and the resumption of inter-Libyan dialogue, according to a Kremlin statement.  About half of the 400,000 people who have fled their homes since Libya\\\\u2019s uprising in 2011 were displaced since the start of Haftar\\\\u2019s offensive last year, according to U.N. estimates.

In its decision, which is binding, the court said the virus \\\\u201capparently is not a pandemic in Pakistan\\\\u201d and questioned why fighting it was \\\\u201cswallowing so much money\\\\u201d.   The court ordered shopping malls to be reopened if health authorities do not object, and curbs to be lifted on businesses opening on the weekends.  The order was issued using the supreme court\\\\u2019s broad authority to issue rulings \\\\u201csuo motu\\\\u201d - on its own motion - without waiting for a particular case to come before it.  Pakistan has reported 42,125 COVID-19 cases and 903 deaths. While those totals are low so far compared to many Western countries, the numbers have risen sharply this month.   Authorities, including Prime Minister Imran Khan, have said the rise in cases has been lower than projected estimates. Faced with the prospect of the lockdown causing economic collapse, they allowed retail markets to reopen last week in a phased lifting of a countrywide lockdown.  Doctors have criticised the reopening, expressing concern that the virus could quickly spread and overwhelm the health system.  \\\\u201cIt will definitely lead to an increase in the number of cases, the number of critical cases,\\\\u201d the secretary of Pakistan\\\\u2019s Young Doctors\\\\u2019 Association, Salman Kazmi, told Reuters this month. \\\\u201cWe are concerned about pressure that will come on the hospitals.\\\\u201d  Re-opened markets were immediately packed with customers last week, with little sign of social distancing or face masks.  The court said that as long as markets were open, there was no justification to shut shopping malls. It found no \\\\u201cjustifiable rational or reasonable\\\\u201d basis for businesses to be ordered to shut over the weekend.  \\\\u201cWe find no reason why so much money is being spent on this Coronavirus (COVID-19), for that, Pakistan is not the country which is seriously affected by it,\\\\u201d the court order said.  The court order came as the country\\\\u2019s railway announced that it will resume limited train operations from May 20, and two of the four Pakistani provinces started opening public transport.  With the Muslim Eid al-Fitr holidays coming up on Sunday or Monday subject to sighting of moon, the transport and retail shopping are expected to draw massive crowds.

President Cyril Ramaphosa imposed a 21-day lockdown from March 26, that was later extended to the end of April.   This prompted property owners and tenants to work together, under government guidelines, to defer rent payments and find other solutions that allow shops, businesses and landlords to ride out the shutdown, which was partially lifted on May 1.  A halt in payments, however, has raised questions over  whether landlords will be able to meet their own debt commitments.  Growthpoint - which owns the V&A Waterfront, home to several corporate head offices, industries, hotels, shops and restaurants - is still finalising rent relief for medium, large and listed tenants for April 2020, it said in a statement.  In April, excluding the V&A, it provided 99.2 million rand ($5.38 million) of rent relief for South African retail, office, industrial and healthcare tenants, while in May it provided 100.8 million rand in relief.  At the V&A, rent discounts totalling 19 million rand were granted for April and about 7 million rand for May, mainly to retailers.   Growthpoint said it had rejected a proposal from the top five fashion retailers - TFG (TFGJ.J), Truworths (TRUJ.J), Mr Price Group (MRPJ.J), Woolworths (WHLJ.J) and Pepkor (PPHJ.J) - to pay only 20% of rates and rental for April 2020.  Together with the Property Industry Group, Growthpoint has approached the government to mediate, it added.  Growthpoint, which also owns Brooklyn Mall in Pretoria, said it had secured a 750 million rand bank loan for three years, and was in the final stages of negotiating a further 900 million rand, also for three years.  After non-food department chain operator Edcon entered business rescue, a form of bankruptcy protection, late in April, Growthpoint is investigating options to sub-divide space occupied by Edcon\\\\u2019s Edgars stores and introduce a second supermarket anchor tenant, where possible, it said.  \\\\u201cIn the interim, the entire industry has received an offer from the business rescue practitioner to pay only turnover rental for the next few months, which we are evaluating,\\\\u201d it added, referring to rent calculated on a tenant\\\\u2019s retail sales.  Growthpoint\\\\u2019s exposure to Edcon, after the sale of stationery retailer CNA, is 88,000 square meters.

The Russian Foreign Ministry said this month that supporters of the move - which would see officials fined if they do not conduct their work in the state language - were \\\\u201cin a clear minority\\\\u201d.  Moscow also urged Uzbekistan, a former Soviet republic, to preserve the official use of Russian, saying it would \\\\u201cfully correspond to the spirit of history, time and the quality of bilateral relations\\\\u201d.  But the Uzbek foreign ministry said in a statement that the new regulations, which are yet to be signed into law, were meant to enforce longstanding rules, and decisions on such matters were \\\\u201can exclusive prerogative of the state\\\\u2019s domestic policy, interference in which is unacceptable\\\\u201d.  The statement did not directly refer to Russia, but mentioned comments by \\\\u201ccertain foreign officials\\\\u201d. The Russian language remains in wide use in the country and millions of Uzbek migrant labourers work in Russia.  The language initiative comes at a time when some Uzbek intellectuals who initially welcomed President Shavkat Mirziyoyev\\\\u2019s reform policies had become more cautious about his rapprochement with Russia.  Uzbekistan decided this year to become an observer in the Russia-led Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) and inked a contract with Rosatom to build a nuclear power plant last year, steps that would have been impossible under Mirziyoyev\\\\u2019s predecessor Islam Karimov, who tried to distance the country from Russia.

The holiday marks the end of the holy fasting month of Ramadan and Turks usually gather with family and friends to celebrate, sometimes travelling to different towns or cities.   The lockdown, which will bar most people from leaving home, is the broadest so far in Turkey, where previous lockdowns have been imposed in 31 or fewer cities.  Confirmed cases of COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the virus, rose to 150,593 on Monday, with 1,158 people diagnosed in the last 24 hours, Turkish health ministry data showed. The death toll stands at 4,171.  Speaking after a cabinet meeting, Erdogan also said schools would only reopen fully with the new academic year in September.  The education ministry said distance learning - via the internet or television - would continue until June 19, the last day of the current academic year.  Turkey has started taking steps to ease lockdown measures aimed at curbing the spread of the coronavirus as the number of daily cases has declined from a peak in April.  Erdogan said mosques would begin allowing mass prayers for midday and afternoon prayers as of May 29. He also said the house arrest period for prisoners who were released as part of coronavirus measures had been extended for two months.  Turkey has conducted more than 1.6 million tests for the coronavirus since the outbreak began.

Denmark last month became the first country in Europe to reopen schools, day-care centres and smaller businesses. It did not see a subsequent rise in COVID-19 cases.  \\\\u201cThe quick shutdown and the fact that Danes actually listened to messages from authorities about good hygiene and social distancing are the main reasons we\\\\u2019ve come this far,\\\\u201d said Hans Jorn Kolmos, a professor in clinical microbiology at the University of Southern Denmark.  Contrary to the French and Italians, Danes are less likely to hug and kiss as a form of greeting, which has also been a factor in limiting the spread, Kolmos said.  Coronavirus-related deaths and the \\\\u2018R\\\\u2019 reproduction rate - a measure of transmission - are falling. Health authorities on Friday reported no deaths for the first time since March 13.  Health experts now say Denmark is \\\\u201cvery unlikely\\\\u201d to be hit by a second wave of the COVID-19 infection that has so far killed 548 people.  With a population of only 5.8 million, the death rate in Denmark is on par with that of Germany with around nine per 100,000 - less than most other European countries, including 36 in neighbouring Sweden, 33 in the Netherlands and 52 in both Britain and Italy.  The results have been achieved without mass testing and contact tracing. Denmark has not recommended the use of face-coverings, as many other countries have.  Early in the outbreak, Denmark shied away from a comprehensive testing and tracing scheme, partly due to a shortage of testing kits, despite calls from the World Health Organization to ramp up testing.  Danish authorities began testing more broadly only in late-April and said last week they would start a tracing scheme.  Denmark was one of the first European countries to announce a lockdown on March 11, restricting public gatherings and closing schools, restaurants and bars, but imposing less strict limits on daily life than in Italy or France.  A month later, the government embarked on its gradual reopening by letting the youngest children go back to school, drawing some concern from medical experts who said it was too early.   Last week, Denmark entered Phase 2 of its easing, allowing shopping malls to reopen followed by cafes and restaurants this week.  \\\\u201cWe now have the coronavirus under control,\\\\u201d said Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen last week.  When the Copenhagen caf\\\\u00e9 Coffee Collective opened its doors to seated customers on Monday, it was quieter than usual. Most enjoyed their coffee alone at tables placed apart, while some sat outside at tables on the street.  \\\\u201cI think it was a good decision (to shut down early), because we can see now on the numbers that everything has worked better than in some neighbouring countries,\\\\u201d said Ellen Vallentin Asmus, a graphic illustrator, enjoying a coffee at the cafe for the first time in two months.   \\\\u201cI think in Denmark there\\\\u2019s a strong culture of following the rules and listening to the government, and I think that has helped with everyone taking the restrictions and social distancing seriously,\\\\u201d said Sydney-Johanna Stevns, a strategist at a research and design lab in Copenhagen.  \\\\u201cMentally it\\\\u2019s nice to be out and have something of a normal life again.\\\\u201d  Danes began returning to work this month but workplaces have restricted the number of employees allowed, leaving public transport half empty.   The fast lockdown and reopening was partly due to Denmark\\\\u2019s centralised government structure, which enabled quick and seamless coordination and a unified voice, said Jan Pravsgaard Christensen, professor in immunology of infectious diseases at the University of Copenhagen.

Congress approved an emergency declaration in March to respond to the coronavirus pandemic, but after an extension in April, the measure was due to expire Sunday. Lawmakers had planned to discuss an extension when they reconvened on Monday.  Less than a year into his administration, Bukele, a brash 38-year-old leader, has repeatedly angered rights groups, who say he has shown authoritarian tendencies. In February, Bukele and a group of soldiers armed with automatic weapons briefly occupied congress. Last month, he released startling photos of hundreds of jailed gang members stripped to underwear and pressed together in formation, horrifying advocates.  Shortly after Bukele issued his decree, the Salvadoran attorney general filed a suit alleging that the move was unconstitutional with the country\\\\u2019s top court.  But Bukele, who swept to the presidency last year with an outsider candidacy, maintained he was well within his rights.  \\\\u201cAll presidents in the democratic history of our country have had the power to declare a state of emergency and have exercised it, without legislative approval,\\\\u201d he wrote in a post on Twitter on Sunday. \\\\u201cWill a president be prevented for the first time from exercising that vital power?\\\\u201d  He struck a more conciliatory tone in a speech Sunday night, urging various arms of the government to come together for the good of the country, though he continued to criticize lawmakers.  Bukele\\\\u2019s administration maintains that a civil protection law authorizes the president to declare a state of emergency if congress cannot hold a session.   They contend that the risk of the coronavirus spreading further in El Salvador justifies the measures. The country has 1,338 confirmed cases of the virus and 30 deaths.  The emergency declaration, which will remain in force over the next 30 days, extends the suspension of classes, restrictions on movement in areas affected by the pandemic and bans on gatherings of large groups. It also authorizes additional government spending during the emergency.   Lawmakers and civil society groups urged an investigation to determine whether Bukele had exceeded his powers.   \\\\u201cWhat would an autocrat do if Congress did not pass a law on his behalf? I would issue a decree. This has just been done by the young Salvadoran leader (Nayib Bukele) with the state of emergency. Another serious setback,\\\\u201d Jos\\\\u00e9 Vivanco, executive director for the Americas for U.S.-based Human Rights Watch, wrote on Twitter.  In recent days, Salvadorans in the capital have protested measures taken during the quarantine, which they say have led to job losses. To avoid breaking social distancing rules, they voice their discontent by banging pots, honking the horns of their vehicles and playing loud music.  Fabricio Benitez, a 26-year-old musician who lives with his parents and sister on the outskirts of San Salvador, said that his father, a soil engineer, lost his job a month ago after his company\\\\u2019s operations were affected by the pandemic.  \\\\u201cWe are subsisting on fairly scarce funds and we have not benefited in any way from government programs,\\\\u201d Benitez said on Friday as he played the Salvadoran national anthem on his viola.

The Czech Republic was among the first countries in Europe to ban entry by foreigners and even banned most Czechs from travelling abroad to keep the spread of the infection under control in March.  Some restrictions have been eased but the country is still not open for foreign tourism and Czechs are required to present a negative coronavirus test upon return or go into quarantine.  Discussions have been underway to open borders with neighbours such as Austria and Slovakia, which have also taken steps to relax their border regimes.  Vojtech said he had proposed that as of June 8, travel to and from a list of risky countries - to be determined but currently likely to include Spain, Italy or France - would be subject to the current requirements while others deemed safe - such as Austria, Slovakia or Croatia - would be exempt.  Vojtech said the list of risky countries would be updated continuously.  Prime Minister Andrej Babis said last week that borders with Slovakia and Austria could be fully opened from June 8.      Separately, Foreign Minister Tomas Petricek said on  Monday that borders with all neighbouring states - Poland, Germany, Austria and Slovakia - could be open by mid-June, news agency CTK reported.   The foreign ministry also said Czech tourists may be allowed to travel to Greece from July.

The 2010 crackdown was a watershed moment in Thailand\\\\u2019s polarised politics that pitted the royalist-military establishment against the \\\\u201cRed Shirt\\\\u201d movement of mostly rural and working class supporters of former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra.  Thaksin supporters staged months of at times violent street protests in Bangkok in protest against a court ruling that dissolved a Thaksin-allied party that had won elections in 2008. Those elections restored democracy two years after the army staged a coup to remove Thaksin.  The standoff ended in a military operation that drove the Red Shirts from Bangkok\\\\u2019s prominent business and tourism district, killing more than 90 people, mostly civilians, and wounding hundreds.  Each year survivors and relatives hold commemorations, but this year\\\\u2019s events are expected to be subdued.  \\\\u201cWe cannot yet organise a large-scale gathering to mark the anniversary because of the coronavirus ... but relatives of those who died will mark the occasion in various places,\\\\u201d said Tida Tawornseth, a former chairwoman of the United Front for Democracy against Dictatorship (UDD), the formal name of the  Red Shirts.  She said she was not hopeful for justice under the current government led by former army chief Prayuth Chan-ocha, who in 2014 overthrew a democratically elected government that had been led by Thakin\\\\u2019s sister, Yingluck Shinawatra.  Prayuth\\\\u2019s pro-army party won elections last year that critics denounced as being manipulated by election regulations and court rulings.  \\\\u201cMany people in power today are figures involved in the conflict 10 years ago. They and the conservative groups are holding on to power,\\\\u201d Tida said.  Prayuth and the courts have denied accusations of manipulating the election results.  This year, commemoration of the 2010 crackdown was joined by the youth-oriented Progressive Movement, which staged a light show last week calling for investigations into the decade-old deaths.  Prayuth declined to directly comment when asked by reporters about the light show, saying the country needs to unify to fight the coronavirus.  \\\\u201cThe recovery for our country after this period requires cooperation from all sides,\\\\u201d Prayuth told reporters. \\\\u201cDo not move on other things to create confusion and disorder.\\\\u201d  Writing by Kay Johnson; editing by Nick Macfie\",\"82\":\"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germans view the United States less positively since the outbreak of the coronavirus crisis while their attitudes towards China have improved, a survey showed on Monday.  In the poll of 1,000 Germans conducted by Kantar Public for the Koerber Foundation, 73% stated their opinion about the United States had deteriorated due to the current health crisis.  This contrasted with 36% of respondents who said their views about China, where the new coronavirus was discovered late last year, had become more negative due to the pandemic.  One out of four survey participants said that their opinion of China had improved. Still, 71% backed the statement that China could have been more transparent in its crisis management to slow down the spread of the virus.  The shift in attitudes means that only 37% of Germans still want closer ties with the United States, sharply down from 50% in the last survey conducted in September 2019.  This compares with 36% who are in favour of closer ties with China, clearly up from 24% in the previous pool.  \\\\u201cGermans\\\\u2019 scepticism about the United States is growing, a worrying trend that should give political decision-makers on both sides of the Atlantic food for thought\\\\u201d, said Nora Mueller, an expert on international affairs at the Koerber Foundation.

Bemba\\\\u2019s lawyers had sought nearly 70 million euros\\\\u00a0($75 million dollars) in compensation for unlawful detention, legal fees and losses due to the alleged mismanagement of assets seized by the court.  On Monday the judges ruled that \\\\u201cno grave and manifest miscarriage of justice occurred\\\\u201d and rejected the claims.   Bemba, a successful businessman and opposition politician before his arrest in 2008, was acquitted in 2018 of crimes committed by members of a militia group under his command.  The judges said Monday that because the court has no statutory limits on how long proceedings can last or on how long an accused is held in pre-trial detention, they could not compensate Bemba for his 10-year stint in the United Nations detention unit.  However they called on the court\\\\u2019s member states to review the statute urgently and said that expeditious proceedings were one of the corner stones of the right to a fair trial.

For more than two years actors, activists and the opposition have contested plans by Socialist Prime Minister Edi Rama to build a new theatre, saying the existing building was part of the country\\\\u2019s heritage, and accused him of corrupt practices.   A large police force showed up before dawn and removed members of the Alliance to Protect the Theatre, using pepper spray. Mechanized diggers then began demolishing its front column, bearing the words \\\\u201cNational Theatre\\\\u201d.  The fate of the building, constructed in 1939 and made into a national theatre in 1945, has divided society, with many angry that Rama had chosen to act during the coronavirus lockdown.  \\\\u201cThis is no longer about the theatre\\\\u2019s demolition but the downfall of democracy and freedom. We are in a dictatorship,\\\\u201d an unidentified member of the alliance said on a Facebook video.  Rama, whose government says the theatre was decrepit and in need of modernisation, stuck to his idea he was pushing for progress, after building a new soccer stadium and market.  \\\\u201cThese are the same people who rise against every project in Tirana. They do not want development, but they cannot stop Tirana,\\\\u201d Rama said in a Facebook post.  Protesters shoved police blocking access to the site and chanted \\\\u201cdown with the dictatorship\\\\u201d, leading to 37 arrests. One policeman was hospitalized after being hit by protesters, while a Reuters witness also saw one protester with head injuries.  One of those arrested, media analyst Alfred Lela, said after his release that police had used unjustified violence and verbal abuse. Policemen kicked protesters, who threw water bottles, according to a Reuters witness.  The police said accusations of violence were untrue.  Critics of the original plan for a new theatre said the work had been awarded to one of the government\\\\u2019s preferred partners without being subject to tender, with the construction of several new high-rise properties included in the deal.  The Socialist government withdrew that plan in February.  Protesters have claimed that a six-month period is required by law for a new project to be approved, and that the government has not secured the proper permits to carry out the demolition.  Mariya Gabriel, the European Union\\\\u2019s Innovation, Research, Culture, Education and Youth Commissioner, last week urged further discussions before any decision was made on the theatre.     Opposition Democratic Party leader Lulzim Basha said the demolition was illegal, and had also \\\\u201cdemolished the foundations of society\\\\u201d.  President Ilir Meta, who holds a largely ceremonial role in government, has complained to the constitutional court about the demolition, which he has called an \\\\u201clegal, moral and constitutional crime\\\\u201d.

Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said the Fund was likely to revise downward its forecast for a 3% contraction in GDP in 2020, but gave no details. That would likely also trigger changes in the Fund\\\\u2019s forecast of a partial recovery of 5.8% in 2021.  In an interview with Reuters, she said data from around the world was worse than expected. \\\\u201cObviously that means it will take us much longer to have a full recovery from this crisis,\\\\u201d Georgieva said in an interview. She gave no specific target date for the rebound.  In April, the global lender forecast that business closures and lockdowns to slow the spread of the virus would throw the world into the deepest recession since the 1930s Great Depression. But data reported since then points to \\\\u201cmore bad news,\\\\u201d Georgieva said earlier this month.  The IMF is due to release new global projections in June. The global outlook remains a huge focus for finance ministers from the Group of Seven advanced economies, who will meet remotely on Tuesday, according to the U.S. Treasury.  Georgieva told Reuters the Fund was focused on risks such as high debt levels, increased deficits, unemployment, bankruptcies, increased poverty and inequality during the recovery period. But she said the crisis was also boosting the digital economy, offering a chance to boost transparency and e-learning, and give even small firms access to markets.  Asked about renewed tensions between the United States and China - the world\\\\u2019s two largest economies, Georgieva said she was urging member countries to maintain open communication and trade flows that had underpinned global growth for decades.  \\\\u201cWe do need to keep trade flows open, especially for medical supplies, food, and longer-term to find a pathway to overcome what is happening now with this crisis,\\\\u201d Georgieva said. \\\\u201cWe want to continue to build this more prosperous future for all by overcoming the scarring that may come from this crisis.\\\\u201d  Tensions between the United States and China have spiked in recent weeks, with officials on both sides suggesting a hard-won deal that defused a bitter 18-month trade war could be abandoned months after it was signed.  Georgieva warned against retreating into protectionism as a result of the crisis.  \\\\u201cWe should not turn away from what has worked for people everywhere: a division of labor and collaboration and trade, which allows the costs of goods and services to go down, allows incomes to go up, and allows poverty within countries and across countries to retreat,\\\\u201d she told Reuters.  The IMF was created after World War Two to foster financial stability, facilitate trade and reduce poverty around the world. It has provided emergency financing to 56 countries since the crisis began and will decide on 47 additional requests as quickly as possible, Georgieva said.  An IMF spokesman said some $21 billion in emergency financing, which carries very low interest rates, had been disbursed thus far.  Georgieva said the Fund could also provide grants to help the poorest countries cover their debt service payments to the IMF through the end of the year, after raising new lending commitments from its members.

The inquiry gathered pace in March after an intelligence sharing meeting between investigators from France, Britain, and Belgium, home to some of Kabuga\\\\u2019s children, as well as Europe\\\\u2019s Europol law enforcement agency and a team from a U.N. tribunal.  The coronavirus lockdown paralysing most of Europe meant many investigations were put on hold, allowing a focus on Kabuga\\\\u2019s file, said Eric Emeraux, head of the Gendarmerie\\\\u2019s Central Office for Combating Crimes Against Humanity.  The dragnet subsequently closed in on one of the alleged chief financiers of the Rwandan genocide, suspected of bankrolling and arming the militias that slaughtered 800,000 ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus in 1994.  \\\\u201cWe realised ... that trail from the children protecting their father converged on Asnieres-sur-Seine,\\\\u201d Emeraux told Reuters, referring to a Paris suburb. \\\\u201cWe also discovered one of his children was renting an apartment there.\\\\u201d  Wiretaps were installed and the property placed under surveillance.

One resident in the same block said Kabuga might have lived there for four or five years.      Reuters has not been able to find any public comment made by Kabuga over the years about the charges. French lawyer Emmanuel Altit said he will be part of the defense team. He did not respond to a subsequent request seeking comment from Kabuga.   Altit was a senior lawyer on the team which successfully secured former Ivorian president Laurent Gbagbo\\\\u2019s acquittal on charges of crimes against humanity at the International Criminal Court in January 2019.

He was formally identified in a DNA test, matching against a sample taken when he was hospitalised in Germany in 2007, Emeraux added.   Kabuga\\\\u2019s arrest marked the end of a more than two-decade-long hunt that spanned Africa and Europe. Kabuga had 28 known aliases and was using a passport from an African country, Emeraux said.       Altit said Kabuga would be arraigned before a Paris court on Tuesday.  The court will set out the legal process before passing the case to investigative judges within eight days. The judges will decide whether to hand Kabuga to the International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals. If Kabuga appeals against their ruling, the matter will go France\\\\u2019s Court of Cassation, which hears whether rulings conform with the law.

Guo said Huawei was committed to complying with U.S. rules and it had significantly increased R&D and inventory to meet U.S. pressures.  Friday\\\\u2019s move by the U.S. Commerce Department expands U.S. authority to require licences for sales to Huawei of semiconductors made abroad with U.S. technology, vastly extending its reach to halt sales to the world\\\\u2019s No. 2 smartphone maker.  The company was added to the Commerce Department\\\\u2019s \\\\u201centity list\\\\u201d a year ago due to national security concerns, amid accusations from Washington that it violated U.S. sanctions on Iran and can spy on customers. Huawei has denied the allegations.   But China hawks in the Trump administration were frustrated that Huawei\\\\u2019s entity listing was not doing enough to curb its access to supplies.  Huawei said the new U.S. decision was \\\\u201carbitrary and pernicious, and threatens to undermine the entire industry worldwide\\\\u201d.  \\\\u201cHuawei categorically opposes the amendments made by the U.S. Department of Commerce to its foreign direct product rule that target Huawei specifically,\\\\u201d it said in a statement, adding that Washington adding it to the entity list a year ago was also without justification.  Guo said that Huawei spent $18.7 billion buying from U.S. suppliers last year and would continue to buy from them if the U.S. government would allow it. He said customers have stood by the company, but acknowledged it had become harder to win contracts since the company was added to the entity list.  The company has had to rewrite 60 million lines of code and invest 15,000+ man years in research and development in a bid to deal with pressures created by being placed on the entity list.  It said Huawei has since remained committed to complying with all U.S. government rules and regulations, but despite its efforts, the U.S. government has decided to proceed and completely ignore the concerns of many companies and industry associations.  Huawei, which needs semiconductors for its smartphones and telecoms equipment, has found itself at the heart of a battle for global technological dominance between the United States and China, whose relationship has soured in recent months over the origins of the deadly coronavirus.

Many of the systems use devices\\\\u2019 Bluetooth signals to estimate the distance between workers, and some of the gadgets show an alert when workers get too close.   Other devices connect to apps that log when two people spend considerable time near other, and authorities can use that data in deciding whom else to quarantine if a worker gets infected.

Reporting by Paresh Dave; Editing by David Gregorio\",\"91\":\"LONDON (Reuters) - Money markets ramped up expectations that the United Kingdom could cut interest rates below zero for the first time as policymakers debated further steps to support the struggling economy, dragging the pound to a more than three-week low.  Interest rate futures contracts from December 2020 dipped into negative territory BOEWATCH on Monday as traders raised bets that the Bank of England would take benchmark interest rates below zero in the coming months.  Unlike the United States where Federal Reserve officials have portrayed a more unified stance in dismissing negative interest rate talk, comments by Andy Haldane, the BoE\\\\u2019s chief economist, over the weekend fuelled speculation that British officials are not averse to going down that path.  \\\\u201cWhile we don\\\\u2019t think that negative interest rates are a near-term possibility as the central bank has a few more bullets left, Haldane\\\\u2019s comments opens the door to that possibility,\\\\u201d said Lee Hardman, an FX strategist at MUFG in London.  The central bank is looking more urgently at options such as negative rates and buying riskier assets to prop up the country\\\\u2019s economy as it slides into a deep coronavirus-driven slump, Haldane was quoted as saying in the Telegraph newspaper over the weekend.  Later on Monday, rate-setter Silvana Tenreyro talked up the benefits of negative rates, citing the experience of other countries in Europe.  \\\\u201cMy personal view, which comes from the reading of the European experiences, is that negative rates have had a positive effect in the sense of having a fairly powerful transmission to real activity,\\\\u201d she told a London School of Economics webinar.  Top BoE officials have previously expressed objections to taking rates below zero - as the central banks of the euro zone and Japan have done - because it might hinder the ability of banks in Britain to lend and hurt rather than help the economy.  But with the BoE\\\\u2019s benchmark at an all-time low of 0.1% and Britain facing potentially its sharpest economic downturn in 300 years, talk of cutting rates to below zero has resurfaced.  Despite opposition from U.S. Federal Reserve officials to cutting policy rates below zero, Richard McGuire, head of rates at Rabobank, said negative rates are plausible on both sides of the Atlantic as, \\\\u201cexploding debt stocks will only be manageable through constrained borrowing costs.\\\\u201d   Futures contracts from December 2020 have dipped into negative territory while contracts maturing in June 2021 are pricing in as much as minus 0.03% in benchmark policy rates.  Short-end British bond yields also fell.  Two-year government bond yields GB2YT=RR, often viewed as an indicator of where official rates are headed, fell back into negative territory and is within striking distance of a record low of minus 0.05% hit last week.  Talk of negative interest rates has steadily pushed shorter-dated bond yields lower as markets have noted the central bank is nearing the limits of the amounts of government bonds it can keep purchasing without damaging markets.  Although the BoE has a self-imposed issue limit of 70%, and chooses not to buy gilts with a maturity of less than three years, HSBC strategists say the proportion of the free float that can be bought is substantially lower than 70%, especially in the longer end of the curve.  Those limits could push the central bank to remove its self-imposed restrictions on purchasing debt for sub 3-year maturities, target the shape of the yield curve or ultimately, implement negative interest rates.      The possibility of negative interest rates would also hurt the pound more at a time when the stalemate between Britain and the EU on Brexit talks is keeping investor sentiment downbeat.      The latest round of Brexit negotiations has raised the prospect that there will be no deal struck on Britain\\\\u2019s formal departure from the bloc after the end of the current transition period at the end of this year.

The U.S. retailer\\\\u2019s six French warehouses have been closed since a court backed union complaints, and ordered Amazon to restrict deliveries to essential items during the pandemic or face hefty fines.  The 10,600 permanent and temporary staff employed at the warehouses will progressively return to work by June 2, according to an agreement signed by five French unions last week and seen by Reuters.   During a first phase, starting on Tuesday and ending next Monday, a maximum of 50% of staff will be allowed to work, on a voluntary basis. As of Monday afternoon, about 30% of workers had volunteered to resume work on Tuesday, the three union officials said.   A spokeswoman for Amazon declined to comment on the number of employees set to return to work on Tuesday.   \\\\u201cWhat we\\\\u2019re interested in is that we can start over on a sound and sustainable basis,\\\\u201d she said.  Under the deal, voluntary workers will get a bonus of 2 euros per hour until June 2. During that same period, employees who stay at home will still receive their full salary.   Amazon also agreed to reduce the working day by 15 minutes. That will create a delay of about 30 minutes between the morning and night shifts, reducing numbers in changing rooms and at entrance gates.   The agreement also lifts restrictions on what kind of products Amazon can send to clients across France.   The court had ruled Amazon should restrict deliveries to IT products, health items, food and pet food while the company reviewed its coronavirus-related health policies.   An external firm, Progexa, has been hired to review the health measures implemented by Amazon, the agreement said.   \\\\u201cWe\\\\u2019ve buried the hatchet,\\\\u201d said SUD union leader Laurent Degous\\\\u00e9e, who led the lawsuit against Amazon.  However, Amazon said the deal made no fundamental changes to the measures it had already put in place when it decided to close its warehouses on April 16.

Cybercrime has spiked during the epidemic with many people forced to work and shop online.  \\\\u201cWhat is most worrying is the increased online activity by those seeking child sexual abuse material,\\\\u201d Europol director Catherine De Bolle told a hearing in the EU Parliament.  De Bolle, a former head of the Belgian police, said the rise in paedophile activities was reported by national law enforcement authorities from the 27 EU states who saw higher access to illegal websites and shut more online platforms for the exchange of child sex material.  She said that Europol investigators had also intercepted offenders claiming easier access to children in conversations on the dark web, a part of the internet which is accessible only with specific software or authorisation.  Sexual abusers are trying to exploit children\\\\u2019s growing exposure to the web, as throughout lockdowns they turn to online lessons, sometimes through platforms that are not adequately secured, De Bolle said.  \\\\u201cWe expect to have more and a better view on the situation when children will be able to go to school again and they will have the possibility to talk to teachers,\\\\u201d De Bolle told lawmakers.  In many European countries, schools are still shut to contain the pandemic.  Hot lines for reporting abuse also received more calls as children were locked down, De Bolle said. In March, these alerts rose in Spain to a record level for that period of the year, a Europol report showed.    \\\\u201cUsing the internet to sexually exploit children today is easier than ever,\\\\u201d said ECPAT, a network of civil society organisations against the commercial sexual exploitation of children.   It said that it was now simpler for paedophiles to get in contact with children and to find like-minded offenders, \\\\u201cwhich also makes it easier to access, download, produce and share child sexual abuse material\\\\u201d.

Reporting by Andrea Shalal\",\"95\":\"DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ryanair shares surged 15% on Monday after Europe\\\\u2019s largest low-cost carrier announced details of sharp cost cuts and promised a swift return to full capacity and expansion in the aftermath of the COVID-19 crisis.  The Irish airline, which is due to move from a skeleton service to around half its normal capacity on July 1, said it had seen a \\\\u201csignificant spike up in bookings\\\\u201d and suggested it may fly more passengers next year than last year.   The bullish commentary from Chief Executive Michael O\\\\u2019Leary marked a sharp contrast with rivals, several of which have requested significant state support and indicated they will exit the crisis as smaller airlines.  The Irish airline on Monday announced a profit of 1 billion euros for the 12 months to the end of March, slightly ahead of analyst forecasts.   Ryanair expects to post a loss of a little more than 200 million euros in the three months to the end of June and either break even or post a small loss for July-September. A profit forecast for the year, O\\\\u2019Leary said, was \\\\u201cimpossible.\\\\u201d   While the forecasts were \\\\u201cloose\\\\u201d due to the plethora of variables, investors were impressed by the direction of travel set out by Ryanair with respect to cost cuts and the speed of a return to more normal passenger numbers, Goodbody analyst Mark Simpson said.  Ryanair\\\\u2019s announcement that it had cut its weekly cash burn to a little more than 60 million euros in May from about 200 million euros in March was another factor in the share bounce.   O\\\\u2019Leary said cash burn is now around 10-15 million euros per week when the cost of unneeded fuel hedges are excluded, which he described as \\\\u201calmost zero.\\\\u201d   Ryanair reported a cash balance of 4.1 billion euros, including 600 million pounds raised under Britain\\\\u2019s Covid Corporate Financing Facility.  \\\\u201cThey are managing the cash very well, they have contained the losses reasonably and they are back flying,\\\\u201d said Stephen Furlong, an analyst at Davy stockbrokers. \\\\u201cIt looks like things are somewhat under control.\\\\u201d   O\\\\u2019Leary reiterated plans to cut at least 3,250 jobs and pay cuts of up to 20%, though he said both could be reversed in the coming years as Boeing begins to deliver dozens of 737 MAX jets per year - starting with 20-30 by summer 2021.   O\\\\u2019Leary said the airline would first look at the possible closure of loss-making bases in Britain, Germany and Spain.   It is also likely to close the main base of its Lauda subsidiary in Austria, which O\\\\u2019Leary said is facing an \\\\u201cexistential crisis\\\\u201d.   \\\\u201cWe need pay cuts. We need job losses, we need lower airport costs if we are going to right-size the business,\\\\u201d he said.   But he also said he expected Ryanair to carry over 150 million passengers in the year to March 2022, up from 149 in the year to March 2021. The failure of rival airlines will create \\\\u201conce in a lifetime\\\\u201d growth opportunities in the coming years, he said.  O\\\\u2019Leary forecast a \\\\u201cdomino effect\\\\u201d of countries scrapping restrictions on travel in June as the tourism industry in countries like Spain and Portugal lobby to match Italy in allowing foreign tourists to return from June 3.  He accused Britain of \\\\u201cidiotic\\\\u201d mismanagement of the COVID-19 crisis but said the government would likely be \\\\u201cembarrassed\\\\u201d into dropping its plan for a 14-day quarantine of travellers arriving from abroad.  Reporting by Conor Humphries; Editing by David Goodman, Mark Heinrich and Jon Boyle\",\"96\":\"BRATISLAVA (Reuters) - Slovakia\\\\u2019s prime minister said on Monday he hoped his compatriots would be able to \\\\u201clive freely again\\\\u201d in about two weeks as daily increases in new coronavirus cases have remained mostly in single digits since late April.  Igor Matovic, who has previously struck a very cautious tone on lifting lockdown restrictions, said shopping malls, cinemas and theatres would reopen on Wednesday and public events with up to 100 people would be allowed under strict hygiene conditions.  Slovakia imposed a tough lockdown early in the crisis, before it had reported any new coronavirus cases. As of Sunday, it had reported 1,495 cases and 28 deaths, among the lowest per-capita figures in the EU. It recorded one new case on Sunday.  \\\\u201cOur common responsibility has enabled this biggest easing (of restrictions) and I hope that in a fortnight we will be able to announce that we can live freely again,\\\\u201d Matovic told a news conference.   Slovaks will be able to travel freely for up to 24 hours to eight other European states from Thursday without having to present a negative coronavirus test or facing a two-week quarantine upon return, Matovic said.  The eight countries are Germany, the Czech Republic, Austria, Poland, Hungary, Croatia, Switzerland and Slovenia.   Wearing face masks outside will no longer be obligatory from Wednesday but people must remain five metres apart. Masks, which Slovakia was among the first European nations to require, will remain compulsory in indoor areas such as shops and offices.  Slovakia will reopen kindergartens and the first five grades of primary school from June 1, with participation on a voluntary basis, Matovic said.  Commenting on the low death toll, Alexandra Brazinova, an epidemiologist from the Faculty of Medicine at Comenius University, said Slovakia had learned from the mistakes of others and had also started testing early on in care homes.  \\\\u201cMany countries introduced (all of) these measures, too, but later, when the disease had spread in the population,\\\\u201d she said.  The launch of phone applications should help combat any new wave of the virus, and \\\\u201cperhaps with fewer restrictions for the public\\\\u201d than this time, Brazinova added.  The lockdown has taken a heavy toll on Slovakia\\\\u2019s economy, which the central bank expects to shrink by 9% this year.

Central banks elsewhere in Europe and in Japan have tried negative interest rates with mixed results. The idea is to discourage banks from holding excess cash and to encourage lending, boosting business investment and consumer spending.  \\\\u201cMy personal view, which comes from the reading of the European experiences, is that negative rates have had a positive effect in the sense of having a fairly powerful transmission to real activity,\\\\u201d she said.  Tenreyro added that there would be specific considerations for Britain given its large financial sector.  BoE officials have previously expressed objections to taking rates below zero - as the central banks of the euro zone and Japan have done - because it might hinder the ability of banks in Britain to lend and hurt rather than help the economy.  But money markets on Monday ramped up expectations of negative interest rates after the BoE\\\\u2019s chief economist said it was looking more urgently at options like negative rates and buying riskier assets as Britain slides into a deep coronavirus-driven slump.
