Hours after President Donald Trump railed against him on Twitter, whistleblower Rick Bright testified to a U.S. House of Representatives panel about readiness for the outbreak.

Our window of opportunity is closing.

The pandemic has infected nearly 1.4 million people in the United States, gutted the economy and killed more than 82,000.

In a whistleblower complaint filed with a government watchdog last week, Bright said that he warned about the virus in January and was met with hostility from HHS leaders.  Bright, who was reassigned to a new government job last month, said he was ousted from BARDA because he resisted efforts to push the drugs hydroxychloroquine and the related chloroquine as cures for COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the coronavirus.  Bright said in the statement last month that the U.S. government has promoted the medicines as a \u201cpanacea\u201d even though they \u201cclearly lack scientific merit.\u201d  HHS spokeswoman Caitlin Oakley has disputed Bright\u2019s account, saying in a statement on Tuesday that he was transferred to a job where he was entrusted to spend around $1 billion to develop diagnostic testing.  \u201cWe are deeply disappointed that he has not shown up to work on behalf of the American people and lead on this critical endeavor,\u201d Oakley said.

Treasury and central bank officials have held bilateral talks in recent days with counterparts from Japan and the United Kingdom on setting up currency swap lines, and with Qatar and China on expanding existing facilities, the officials said.   Cevdet Yilmaz, the ruling AK Party\u2019s deputy chairman for foreign affairs, confirmed on Thursday that Turkey was seeking swap agreements.  \u201cWe are having negotiations with different central banks for swap opportunities,\u201d he told a panel discussion, adding: \u201cIt is not only the U.S., there are also other countries.\u201d  He did not give further details.     The push comes after the lira TRYTOM=D3 hit a historic low last week, limiting Ankara's capacity to address concerns over its depleted foreign reserves and hefty debt obligations.   One of the officials told Reuters Turkey was feeling confident after the talks. But it was unclear how close it may be to securing any deals as the coronavirus pandemic stretches governments and central banks like never before.   Turkey\u2019s Treasury ministry, Japan\u2019s finance ministry and the Bank of England declined to comment. The People\u2019s Bank of China did not respond to a faxed request for comment. Qatar\u2019s government media office did not respond to a query about expanding the swaps with Ankara.      If Turkey cannot secure tens of billions of dollars worth of funding, analysts say it risks a currency spiral tmsnrt.rs\/2L5ks0o similar to 2018, when the lira briefly shed half its value in a crisis that shook emerging markets.  The government has said its forex buffer is adequate. This week, President Tayyip Erdogan blamed the lira\u2019s fall on \u201cthose who think they can destroy our economy, put shackles on our feet, corner us by using financial institutions abroad\u201d.  The diplomatic effort comes as the coronavirus pandemic here is expected to trigger a recession.  It suggests Turkey is looking beyond its preferred source of funding, the U.S. Federal Reserve, and may have to consider tougher decisions on interest rates or options it has dismissed, such as IMF assistance or capital controls, investors say.  \u201cTalks are in a better position especially with Qatar, China and Britain,\u201d said the first senior official, who requested anonymity. \u201cI am optimistic that a certain amount of resources will be provided\u201d and an agreement should \u201cnot take too long\u201d.  The two other officials said Turkey reached out to Japanese representatives about possible funding, with one adding that talks need to be speeded up if a swap line is to be secured.  The Turkish central bank's net foreign currency reserves tmsnrt.rs\/3bOJYmo have dropped to $26 billion from $40 billion this year. Bankers say that was largely due to state lenders selling some $30 billion in FX markets to support the lira, which has nonetheless fallen 15% this year.   GRAPHIC: Turkey's eroding financial buffer - here  The country\u2019s 12-month foreign debt obligations are $168 billion, with about half due by August, while disappearing tourism income has inflated its monthly current account deficit to nearly $5 billion.   \u201cI don\u2019t really see how Turkey can navigate this period, especially considering their external vulnerabilities,\u201d said Shamaila Khan, director of emerging markets debt at AllianceBernstein in New York.   Turkey has underestimated its risks \u201cunfortunately for months now\u201d said Khan, who was among hundreds of investors on a conference call with Finance Minister Berat Albayrak last week.   On the call, Albayrak said reserves are adequate and he was optimistic about negotiating new funding with fellow G20 nations and trade partners, according to participants and a brief ministry summary.  He singled out countries with whom Turkey has large trade deficits and promised an update to existing swap lines, one investor said. Turkey has currency swap facilities worth $1.7 billion with China and $5 billion with Qatar.   The Fed extended dollar swap lines to several countries in March but it appears unlikely to add Turkey despite Ankara\u2019s appeal to Washington, based on comments from current and former officials. The U.S. central bank declined to comment.   A Japanese government official said Tokyo has no plan for now beyond monitoring the lira, but added the Group of Seven (G7) countries or the International Monetary Fund would rescue Turkey \u201cif it morphs into a real crisis.\u201d  Any significant weakening of the lira beyond 7 per dollar, where it has stabilized, could erode support for Erdogan, whose party lost local elections last year on the heels of the 2018 crisis that sent inflation and unemployment soaring.   GRAPHIC: Turkish lira timeline from 2013 - here  His government has imposed tighter limits on local bank FX trading and opened investigations into global firms UBS, Citigroup and BNP Paribas.   Investors and bankers say it would need to act fast to restore confidence tmsnrt.rs\/2L4x3kB if companies begin missing foreign debt payments or Turks start withdrawing deposits.  They say rate hikes are one avenue, followed by IMF funding \u2014 an option both Erdogan and Albayrak have dismissed.   \u201cThis feels like a rerun of the last lira crisis,\u201d said Win Thin, global head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman. \u201cSurprisingly little has changed fundamentally in the nearly two years that have passed (except policies) that make it even harder to invest in Turkey.\u201d  Only in a worst-case scenario would Turkey adopt capital controls, such as limits on transfers or withdrawals, which would harm its market credibility, investors and bankers said.

Treasury and central bank officials have held bilateral talks in recent days with counterparts from Japan and the United Kingdom on setting up currency swap lines, and with Qatar and China on expanding existing facilities, the officials said.   Cevdet Yilmaz, the ruling AK Party\u2019s deputy chairman for foreign affairs, confirmed on Thursday that Turkey was seeking swap agreements.  \u201cWe are having negotiations with different central banks for swap opportunities,\u201d he told a panel discussion, adding: \u201cIt is not only the U.S., there are also other countries.\u201d  He did not give further details.     The push comes after the lira TRYTOM=D3 hit a historic low last week, limiting Ankara's capacity to address concerns over its depleted foreign reserves and hefty debt obligations.   One of the officials told Reuters Turkey was feeling confident after the talks. But it was unclear how close it may be to securing any deals as the coronavirus pandemic stretches governments and central banks like never before.   Turkey\u2019s Treasury ministry, Japan\u2019s finance ministry and the Bank of England declined to comment. The People\u2019s Bank of China did not respond to a faxed request for comment. Qatar\u2019s government media office did not respond to a query about expanding the swaps with Ankara.      If Turkey cannot secure tens of billions of dollars worth of funding, analysts say it risks a currency spiral tmsnrt.rs\/2L5ks0o similar to 2018, when the lira briefly shed half its value in a crisis that shook emerging markets.  The government has said its forex buffer is adequate. This week, President Tayyip Erdogan blamed the lira\u2019s fall on \u201cthose who think they can destroy our economy, put shackles on our feet, corner us by using financial institutions abroad\u201d.  The diplomatic effort comes as the coronavirus pandemic here is expected to trigger a recession.  It suggests Turkey is looking beyond its preferred source of funding, the U.S. Federal Reserve, and may have to consider tougher decisions on interest rates or options it has dismissed, such as IMF assistance or capital controls, investors say.  \u201cTalks are in a better position especially with Qatar, China and Britain,\u201d said the first senior official, who requested anonymity. \u201cI am optimistic that a certain amount of resources will be provided\u201d and an agreement should \u201cnot take too long\u201d.  The two other officials said Turkey reached out to Japanese representatives about possible funding, with one adding that talks need to be speeded up if a swap line is to be secured.  The Turkish central bank's net foreign currency reserves tmsnrt.rs\/3bOJYmo have dropped to $26 billion from $40 billion this year. Bankers say that was largely due to state lenders selling some $30 billion in FX markets to support the lira, which has nonetheless fallen 15% this year.   GRAPHIC: Turkey's eroding financial buffer - here  The country\u2019s 12-month foreign debt obligations are $168 billion, with about half due by August, while disappearing tourism income has inflated its monthly current account deficit to nearly $5 billion.   \u201cI don\u2019t really see how Turkey can navigate this period, especially considering their external vulnerabilities,\u201d said Shamaila Khan, director of emerging markets debt at AllianceBernstein in New York.   Turkey has underestimated its risks \u201cunfortunately for months now\u201d said Khan, who was among hundreds of investors on a conference call with Finance Minister Berat Albayrak last week.   On the call, Albayrak said reserves are adequate and he was optimistic about negotiating new funding with fellow G20 nations and trade partners, according to participants and a brief ministry summary.  He singled out countries with whom Turkey has large trade deficits and promised an update to existing swap lines, one investor said. Turkey has currency swap facilities worth $1.7 billion with China and $5 billion with Qatar.   The Fed extended dollar swap lines to several countries in March but it appears unlikely to add Turkey despite Ankara\u2019s appeal to Washington, based on comments from current and former officials. The U.S. central bank declined to comment.   A Japanese government official said Tokyo has no plan for now beyond monitoring the lira, but added the Group of Seven (G7) countries or the International Monetary Fund would rescue Turkey \u201cif it morphs into a real crisis.\u201d  Any significant weakening of the lira beyond 7 per dollar, where it has stabilized, could erode support for Erdogan, whose party lost local elections last year on the heels of the 2018 crisis that sent inflation and unemployment soaring.   GRAPHIC: Turkish lira timeline from 2013 - here  His government has imposed tighter limits on local bank FX trading and opened investigations into global firms UBS, Citigroup and BNP Paribas.   Investors and bankers say it would need to act fast to restore confidence tmsnrt.rs\/2L4x3kB if companies begin missing foreign debt payments or Turks start withdrawing deposits.  They say rate hikes are one avenue, followed by IMF funding \u2014 an option both Erdogan and Albayrak have dismissed.   \u201cThis feels like a rerun of the last lira crisis,\u201d said Win Thin, global head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman. \u201cSurprisingly little has changed fundamentally in the nearly two years that have passed (except policies) that make it even harder to invest in Turkey.\u201d  Only in a worst-case scenario would Turkey adopt capital controls, such as limits on transfers or withdrawals, which would harm its market credibility, investors and bankers said.   The first Turkish official said some steps were taken to prevent \u201cspeculative attacks\u201d on the currency, but that capital controls \u201care certainly not on the agenda\u201d.

Under a coalition agreement with his former election rival, centrist Benny Gantz, Netanyahu would serve as prime minister for 18 months before the former armed forces chief replaces him.  Their power-sharing deal ends more than a year of political deadlock in which three inconclusive elections were held and Netanyahu was indicted in three criminal cases on corruption charges he denies.   Gantz agreed to delay the government\u2019s swearing-in ceremony to give Netanyahu more time to allocate cabinet posts to members of his Likud party, a joint statement said.   Their pact split Gantz\u2019s centrist party, Blue and White. He cited the coronavirus crisis as a main reason for reneging on campaign promises not to partner with a prime minister under a corruption cloud.  The unity agreement would leave Netanyahu in power throughout a trial due to begin on May 24, the first such proceedings against a sitting Israeli prime minister, enabling him to maintain a powerful public pulpit in fighting back against what he has termed a political witch-hunt.  It also opens the way for the right-wing Netanyahu to move ahead with a pledged de facto annexation of territory in the occupied West Bank - land that the Palestinians seek for a state and which Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war.  Netanyahu has set July 1 as a starting point for cabinet discussions on his plan to extend Israeli sovereignty to Jewish settlements and the Jordan Valley in the West Bank. He has given no stated deadline for implementing the move.  Annexation, vehemently opposed by the Palestinians who have urged international sanctions against Israel in response, would be certain to heighten tensions in the West Bank and Gaza that could ignite violence and draw international outrage.      On an eight-hour visit to Israel on Wednesday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in an interview with the Israel Hayom newspaper that West Bank territorial steps were an Israeli decision that Netanyahu had a right to make.  Pompeo noted, however, that the issue was complex and required coordination with Washington, which has formed a joint team with Israel to map out new territorial lines in the West Bank under a Middle East peace plan announced by U.S. President Donald Trump in January.

The United States has a \u201chigh degree of certainty\u201d that Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro\u2019s government is paying Iran tons of gold for the fuel, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.   \u201cIt is not only unwelcome by the United States but it\u2019s unwelcome by the region, and we\u2019re looking at measures that can be taken,\u201d the official said.  The oil sectors of Iran and Venezuela - members of OPEC that both are deeply at odds with the United States - are under tough U.S. sanctions. The official declined to specify the measures being weighed but said options would be presented to Trump, a fierce critic of the governments of both Iran and Venezuela.  At least one tanker carrying fuel loaded at an Iranian port has set sail for Venezuela, according to vessel tracking data from Refinitiv Eikon on Wednesday, which could help ease an acute scarcity of gasoline in the South American country.  The Iran-flagged medium tanker Clavel earlier on Wednesday passed the Suez Canal after loading fuel at the end of March at Iran\u2019s Bandar Abbas port, according to the data.   Venezuela is in desperate need of gasoline and other refined fuel products to keep the country functioning amid an economic collapse that has occurred under Maduro. It produces crude oil but its infrastructure has been crippled during the economic crisis.  The shipment marks the latest sign of cooperation between the Iran and Venezuela. Starting last month, several flights from Tehran have brought materials to Venezuela to help it restart the catalytic cracking unit at its 310,000 barrel-per-day Cardon refinery, drawing U.S. condemnation.  Venezuela\u2019s 1.3 million-bpd refining network has all but collapsed due to under-investment and lack of maintenance in recent years under the socialist Maduro.  Last year, the United States imposed sanctions on state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA) as part of Trump administration efforts to oust Maduro, whose 2018 re-election was considered a sham by most Western countries.  The United States and dozens of other nations recognized opposition leader Juan Guaido as interim president last year. But Maduro, who calls Guaido a U.S. puppet, remains in power, backed by Venezuela\u2019s military as well as Russia, China, Cuba and Iran.  Some U.S. officials have said this has been a growing source of frustration for Trump.  The United States also maintains punishing sanctions on Iran aimed at containing its regional power in the Middle East, measures that were re-imposed after Trump pulled out of an international nuclear deal with Tehran.  Four other vessels of the same size as the Clavel, all flagged by Iran and loaded with fuel at or near Bandar Abbas, are about to cross the Atlantic Ocean after passing Suez. They have not yet set their final destinations, data showed.  One of them, the Fortune, appears on a list of tankers scheduled to enter Venezuelan port, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. Opposition politicians also said they had received information that all five tankers were heading to Venezuela.

They have not yet set their final destinations, data showed.  One of them, the Fortune, appears on a list of tankers scheduled to enter Venezuelan port, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. Opposition politicians also said they had received information that all five tankers were heading to Venezuela.  The U.S. official said Venezuela\u2019s need to resort to Iranian fuel showed the Maduro government\u2019s \u201cdesperation.\u201d  \u201cWe\u2019ve spoken to enough people and I\u2019ve seen enough to have a high degree of certainty\u201d that Iran is getting paid with \u201ca handsome amount of gold,\u201d the official added, declining to elaborate.  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo last month called on countries to deny overflight rights to Mahan Air, an Iranian airline under U.S. sanctions, which he said delivered cargoes of \u201cunknown support\u201d to the Venezuelan government.

The National Coronavirus Command Council, the government body overseeing efforts to contain the virus, will review the restrictions for each district every two weeks, Mkhize added, saying the country was moving away from a \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d approach.  It was not immediately clear whether there would be restrictions on movement between districts, which vary widely in size and in population.  South Africa imposed one of the world\u2019s strictest lockdowns in late March, only allowing people to leave their homes under a narrow set of circumstances, such as buying food or seeking medical help.  Restrictions were eased slightly on May 1, and President Cyril Ramaphosa said on Wednesday that further easing would happen cautiously.  Trade and industry minister Ebrahim Patel relaxed rules on e-commerce on Thursday, allowing online firms to resume selling goods apart from alcohol and tobacco under strict health and safety controls.  Mkhize, a former medical doctor who has won praise for his handling of the coronavirus crisis, said the new district-based approach reflected the need to balance the risks of continuing economic restrictions with the likelihood of an upsurge in COVID-19 cases if restrictions ended abruptly.  \u201cDepending on the average active cases per 100,000 people, districts will be individually assigned levels of lockdown to prevent the spread of the virus,\u201d Mkhize said.  He said the government was working hard to increase the number of beds in hospitals and that cluster outbreaks in and around Cape Town were driving infections in the Western Cape and Eastern Cape provinces, two of the most badly affected.  South Africa has recorded 238 coronavirus deaths, with 12,739 confirmed cases. Almost 70% of the cases are from the Western Cape and Eastern Cape.  The parts of the country with the highest rates of infection, including metropolitan areas, are likely to remain under stringent restrictions into June, Ramaphosa said on Wednesday.  That will take a heavy toll on the economy, which was already in recession before COVID-19 struck, and increase daily hardships for millions of poor South Africans.

The lawmakers, led by Michigan Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib, Oregon Senator Jeff Merkley and including former candidates Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, raised concerns about an April 30 move by the Fed that expanded the Main Street Lending Facility to companies with up 15,000 employees and $5 billion in revenue - up from a cap of 10,000 workers and $2.5 billion in revenue when the program was first announced on April 9.  That expansion allowed a larger number of oil and gas drillers to access the program.  The letter to Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said the expansion was a \u201cback-door bailout of the oil and gas sector, done at the urging of President Trump.\u201d  \u201cWe request that you undo this lending facility\u2019s expansion and refrain from engaging in future actions targeted at any industry, especially the oil and gas industry,\u201d they wrote.  They argued that the Fed, an independent body, should \u201cguard itself\u201d against lobbying and political pressure and that extending lending to oil and gas companies could harm financial stability because of volatility in the oil markets.  \u201cThese companies have created systemic-level risks to the U.S. financial system,\u201d they wrote.  The lending program has not yet been launched, so no companies have yet applied for financial assistance.  The American Petroleum Institute, which represents the oil and gas industry, said its member companies should have access to federal programs designed to help companies survive the economic upheaval due to the pandemic.   \u201cWe are focused on ensuring that our industry has the same access as other industries to these economy-wide programs that Congress authorized to provide systemic liquidity and promote employment during this period of economic decline,\u201d Frank Macchiarola, senior vice president for Policy, Economics and Regulatory Affairs at API said in an email.

But Anna Popova, a senior health official, said Russia had managed to stop the growth rate of infection after authorities reported a one-day rise in new coronavirus cases of fewer than 10,000 for the first time in almost two weeks.   Putin, speaking at a televised government meeting via video link, said it was \u201cno secret\u201d that Valery Falkov, 41, the minister of science and higher education, had tested positive and recovered, and asked him how he was feeling.   \u201cThank you Vladimir Vladimirovich, I\u2019m better already and I\u2019m actively back at work,\u201d the minister replied.

Rodgerson confirmed reports on the rescue size on an analysts\u2019 call, saying he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d with the value but that he understood Brazil lacked resources for a larger bailout.   It will take some 45 days before Azul receives any funding, he said.  The plan, which first centered around a 10 billion reais credit line, has shrunk in value over time as private lenders balked at extending bigger loans and because the airlines were reluctant to accept larger share dilution, said two sources who declined to be identified as the discussions were private.

Reporting by Lisa Lambert; Editing by Chris Reese","34":"WASHINGTON\/LONDON (Reuters) - The Trump administration on Thursday issued guidelines to help ship owners and insurers avoid the risks of sanctions penalties, standards that maritime players and a senior State Department official said were modified following months of discussions with industry.  The guidelines, known as a Global Maritime Advisory, concern sanctions on Iran, North Korea and Syria. The State Department said that it is committed to disrupting sanctions evasion and smuggling of goods, including oil exports from Iran, which the Trump administration imposed sanctions on soon after pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal in 2018.     Global shippers and insurers had balked at an initial outline of the advisory that the State Department had previewed in March, arguing that it would have disrupted international trade with legal questions.  The senior State Department official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said talks with industry had occurred for months, adding that he and his team had held multiple meetings in London, Washington and other parts of the world with the industry so that the end document was not \u201cAmerica-centric.\u201d   \u201cWe have worked through several iterations of this document with industry and each iteration was an improvement upon the previous one,\u201d the official said. \u201cWe have an open line and ongoing dialogues with a range of industry representatives of this industry.\u201d  The Trump administration has ratcheted up its sanctions enforcement on countries like Iran and Venezuela, and has, for example, imposed penalties on a unit of Chinese shipping giant COSCO last year for transporting blacklisted crude. It said it will target intermediaries as well as ship-to-ship transfers.  The maritime advisory was first outlined on March 9 by David Peyman, a State Department deputy assistant secretary. He said then the advisory would, among other things, warn shippers not to turn off transponders and to not store Iranian oil.   Peyman has since left that role to take another job at the State Department, and Andrew Weinschenk is now an acting deputy assistant secretary of state for counter threat finance and sanctions.  A maritime source said the industry was concerned that parts of the original advisory plan, which encouraged ship captains to take photographs of parties conducting ship-to-ship transfers and make them available to the authorities, would have run into legal issues.    Insurers had also been concerned about initial guidelines on ship transponders, which some shippers of sanctioned oil have turned off in the past, but which also sometimes fail during  severe weather.    While the State Department incorporated changes over the last few months, industry still had concerns.   \u201cIt is important to recognize that the sectors of the maritime industry targeted by the guidance are often subject to complex domestic and international regulation that may impose conflicting requirements on a party,\u201d a maritime source said.

Treasury and central bank officials have held bilateral talks in recent days with counterparts from Japan and the United Kingdom on setting up currency swap lines, and with Qatar and China on expanding existing facilities, the officials said.   Cevdet Yilmaz, the ruling AK Party\u2019s deputy chairman for foreign affairs, confirmed on Thursday that Turkey was seeking swap agreements.  \u201cWe are having negotiations with different central banks for swap opportunities,\u201d he told a panel discussion, adding: \u201cIt is not only the U.S., there are also other countries.\u201d  He did not give further details.     The push comes after the lira TRYTOM=D3 hit a historic low last week, limiting Ankara's capacity to address concerns over its depleted foreign reserves and hefty debt obligations.   One of the officials told Reuters Turkey was feeling confident after the talks. But it was unclear how close it may be to securing any deals as the coronavirus pandemic stretches governments and central banks like never before.   Turkey\u2019s Treasury ministry, Japan\u2019s finance ministry and the Bank of England declined to comment. The People\u2019s Bank of China did not respond to a faxed request for comment. Qatar\u2019s government media office did not respond to a query about expanding the swaps with Ankara.      If Turkey cannot secure tens of billions of dollars worth of funding, analysts say it risks a currency spiral tmsnrt.rs\/2L5ks0o similar to 2018, when the lira briefly shed half its value in a crisis that shook emerging markets.  The government has said its forex buffer is adequate. This week, President Tayyip Erdogan blamed the lira\u2019s fall on \u201cthose who think they can destroy our economy, put shackles on our feet, corner us by using financial institutions abroad\u201d.  The diplomatic effort comes as the coronavirus pandemic here is expected to trigger a recession.  It suggests Turkey is looking beyond its preferred source of funding, the U.S. Federal Reserve, and may have to consider tougher decisions on interest rates or options it has dismissed, such as IMF assistance or capital controls, investors say.  \u201cTalks are in a better position especially with Qatar, China and Britain,\u201d said the first senior official, who requested anonymity. \u201cI am optimistic that a certain amount of resources will be provided\u201d and an agreement should \u201cnot take too long\u201d.  The two other officials said Turkey reached out to Japanese representatives about possible funding, with one adding that talks need to be speeded up if a swap line is to be secured.  The Turkish central bank's net foreign currency reserves tmsnrt.rs\/3bOJYmo have dropped to $26 billion from $40 billion this year. Bankers say that was largely due to state lenders selling some $30 billion in FX markets to support the lira, which has nonetheless fallen 15% this year.   GRAPHIC: Turkey's eroding financial buffer - here  The country\u2019s 12-month foreign debt obligations are $168 billion, with about half due by August, while disappearing tourism income has inflated its monthly current account deficit to nearly $5 billion.   \u201cI don\u2019t really see how Turkey can navigate this period, especially considering their external vulnerabilities,\u201d said Shamaila Khan, director of emerging markets debt at AllianceBernstein in New York.   Turkey has underestimated its risks \u201cunfortunately for months now\u201d said Khan, who was among hundreds of investors on a conference call with Finance Minister Berat Albayrak last week.   On the call, Albayrak said reserves are adequate and he was optimistic about negotiating new funding with fellow G20 nations and trade partners, according to participants and a brief ministry summary.  He singled out countries with whom Turkey has large trade deficits and promised an update to existing swap lines, one investor said. Turkey has currency swap facilities worth $1.7 billion with China and $5 billion with Qatar.   The Fed extended dollar swap lines to several countries in March but it appears unlikely to add Turkey despite Ankara\u2019s appeal to Washington, based on comments from current and former officials. The U.S. central bank declined to comment.

The United States has a \u201chigh degree of certainty\u201d that Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro\u2019s government is paying Iran tons of gold for the fuel, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.   \u201cIt is not only unwelcome by the United States but it\u2019s unwelcome by the region, and we\u2019re looking at measures that can be taken,\u201d the official said.  The oil sectors of Iran and Venezuela - members of OPEC that both are deeply at odds with the United States - are under tough U.S. sanctions. The official declined to specify the measures being weighed but said options would be presented to Trump, a fierce critic of the governments of both Iran and Venezuela.  At least one tanker carrying fuel loaded at an Iranian port has set sail for Venezuela, according to vessel tracking data from Refinitiv Eikon on Wednesday, which could help ease an acute scarcity of gasoline in the South American country.  The Iran-flagged medium tanker Clavel earlier on Wednesday passed the Suez Canal after loading fuel at the end of March at Iran\u2019s Bandar Abbas port, according to the data.   Venezuela is in desperate need of gasoline and other refined fuel products to keep the country functioning amid an economic collapse that has occurred under Maduro. It produces crude oil but its infrastructure has been crippled during the economic crisis.  The shipment marks the latest sign of cooperation between the Iran and Venezuela. Starting last month, several flights from Tehran have brought materials to Venezuela to help it restart the catalytic cracking unit at its 310,000 barrel-per-day Cardon refinery, drawing U.S. condemnation.  Venezuela\u2019s 1.3 million-bpd refining network has all but collapsed due to under-investment and lack of maintenance in recent years under the socialist Maduro.  Last year, the United States imposed sanctions on state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA) as part of Trump administration efforts to oust Maduro, whose 2018 re-election was considered a sham by most Western countries.  The United States and dozens of other nations recognized opposition leader Juan Guaido as interim president last year. But Maduro, who calls Guaido a U.S. puppet, remains in power, backed by Venezuela\u2019s military as well as Russia, China, Cuba and Iran.  Some U.S. officials have said this has been a growing source of frustration for Trump.  The United States also maintains punishing sanctions on Iran aimed at containing its regional power in the Middle East, measures that were re-imposed after Trump pulled out of an international nuclear deal with Tehran.  Four other vessels of the same size as the Clavel, all flagged by Iran and loaded with fuel at or near Bandar Abbas, are about to cross the Atlantic Ocean after passing Suez. They have not yet set their final destinations, data showed.  One of them, the Fortune, appears on a list of tankers scheduled to enter Venezuelan port, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.

The National Coronavirus Command Council, the government body overseeing efforts to contain the virus, will review the restrictions for each district every two weeks, Mkhize added, saying the country was moving away from a \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d approach.  It was not immediately clear whether there would be restrictions on movement between districts, which vary widely in size and in population.  South Africa imposed one of the world\u2019s strictest lockdowns in late March, only allowing people to leave their homes under a narrow set of circumstances, such as buying food or seeking medical help.  Restrictions were eased slightly on May 1, and President Cyril Ramaphosa said on Wednesday that further easing would happen cautiously.  Trade and industry minister Ebrahim Patel relaxed rules on e-commerce on Thursday, allowing online firms to resume selling goods apart from alcohol and tobacco under strict health and safety controls.  Mkhize, a former medical doctor who has won praise for his handling of the coronavirus crisis, said the new district-based approach reflected the need to balance the risks of continuing economic restrictions with the likelihood of an upsurge in COVID-19 cases if restrictions ended abruptly.  \u201cDepending on the average active cases per 100,000 people, districts will be individually assigned levels of lockdown to prevent the spread of the virus,\u201d Mkhize said.  He said the government was working hard to increase the number of beds in hospitals and that cluster outbreaks in and around Cape Town were driving infections in the Western Cape and Eastern Cape provinces, two of the most badly affected.  South Africa has recorded 238 coronavirus deaths, with 12,739 confirmed cases. Almost 70% of the cases are from the Western Cape and Eastern Cape.  The parts of the country with the highest rates of infection, including metropolitan areas, are likely to remain under stringent restrictions into June, Ramaphosa said on Wednesday.  That will take a heavy toll on the economy, which was already in recession before COVID-19 struck, and increase daily hardships for millions of poor South Africans.

The lawmakers, led by Michigan Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib, Oregon Senator Jeff Merkley and including former candidates Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, raised concerns about an April 30 move by the Fed that expanded the Main Street Lending Facility to companies with up 15,000 employees and $5 billion in revenue - up from a cap of 10,000 workers and $2.5 billion in revenue when the program was first announced on April 9.  That expansion allowed a larger number of oil and gas drillers to access the program.  The letter to Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said the expansion was a \u201cback-door bailout of the oil and gas sector, done at the urging of President Trump.\u201d  \u201cWe request that you undo this lending facility\u2019s expansion and refrain from engaging in future actions targeted at any industry, especially the oil and gas industry,\u201d they wrote.  They argued that the Fed, an independent body, should \u201cguard itself\u201d against lobbying and political pressure and that extending lending to oil and gas companies could harm financial stability because of volatility in the oil markets.  \u201cThese companies have created systemic-level risks to the U.S. financial system,\u201d they wrote.  The lending program has not yet been launched, so no companies have yet applied for financial assistance.  The American Petroleum Institute, which represents the oil and gas industry, said its member companies should have access to federal programs designed to help companies survive the economic upheaval due to the pandemic.   \u201cWe are focused on ensuring that our industry has the same access as other industries to these economy-wide programs that Congress authorized to provide systemic liquidity and promote employment during this period of economic decline,\u201d Frank Macchiarola, senior vice president for Policy, Economics and Regulatory Affairs at API said in an email.

But Anna Popova, a senior health official, said Russia had managed to stop the growth rate of infection after authorities reported a one-day rise in new coronavirus cases of fewer than 10,000 for the first time in almost two weeks.   Putin, speaking at a televised government meeting via video link, said it was \u201cno secret\u201d that Valery Falkov, 41, the minister of science and higher education, had tested positive and recovered, and asked him how he was feeling.   \u201cThank you Vladimir Vladimirovich, I\u2019m better already and I\u2019m actively back at work,\u201d the minister replied.   Falkov is the fourth member of Putin\u2019s government known to have caught the coronavirus, including Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin who is still recovering, but has remotely attended at least one government meeting by video conference.   Earlier this week, the Kremlin\u2019s veteran spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said he had also fallen ill with the coronavirus and contracted double pneumonia.      The Kremlin has said the health of Putin, 67, is carefully guarded and most of his recent public appearances have been at government meetings via video link from a room at his residence outside Moscow.  Moscow and much of the country are in their seventh week of a lockdown, but factory and construction workers have gone back to work after Putin said on Monday that a gradual easing of the restrictions was feasible.   On Thursday, Russia\u2019s official coronavirus case tally passed the 250,000 mark after 9,974 new cases were recorded in the last 24 hours, the lowest one-day rise in almost two weeks.  \u201cI would say that today we have halted growth,\u201d Popova said in the preview of a video interview due to be aired on Sunday on the Rossiya-1 television channel.    At 252,245, the case total is the second highest in the world after the United States, although authorities say the high figure shows how thoroughly officials are testing people.   Ninety-three people died overnight, pushing the death toll to 2,305, a level that is well below many countries and has prompted the Kremlin\u2019s critics to cast doubt on the accuracy of the figure. Officials deny any data manipulation.

Falkov is the fourth member of Putin\u2019s government known to have caught the coronavirus, including Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin who is still recovering, but has remotely attended at least one government meeting by video conference.   Earlier this week, the Kremlin\u2019s veteran spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said he had also fallen ill with the coronavirus and contracted double pneumonia.      The Kremlin has said the health of Putin, 67, is carefully guarded and most of his recent public appearances have been at government meetings via video link from a room at his residence outside Moscow.  Moscow and much of the country are in their seventh week of a lockdown, but factory and construction workers have gone back to work after Putin said on Monday that a gradual easing of the restrictions was feasible.   On Thursday, Russia\u2019s official coronavirus case tally passed the 250,000 mark after 9,974 new cases were recorded in the last 24 hours, the lowest one-day rise in almost two weeks.  \u201cI would say that today we have halted growth,\u201d Popova said in the preview of a video interview due to be aired on Sunday on the Rossiya-1 television channel.    At 252,245, the case total is the second highest in the world after the United States, although authorities say the high figure shows how thoroughly officials are testing people.   Ninety-three people died overnight, pushing the death toll to 2,305, a level that is well below many countries and has prompted the Kremlin\u2019s critics to cast doubt on the accuracy of the figure. Officials deny any data manipulation.    Moscow\u2019s mayor, Sergei Sobyanin, said on Thursday that authorities would begin free mass testing of residents from Friday and that they aimed to be testing 100,000 people a day by the end of the month.

Rodgerson confirmed reports on the rescue size on an analysts\u2019 call, saying he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d with the value but that he understood Brazil lacked resources for a larger bailout.   It will take some 45 days before Azul receives any funding, he said.  The plan, which first centered around a 10 billion reais credit line, has shrunk in value over time as private lenders balked at extending bigger loans and because the airlines were reluctant to accept larger share dilution, said two sources who declined to be identified as the discussions were private.  Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA (GOLL4.SA) and Azul may now receive 2 billion reais each. It is unclear if a deal will be reached with Chilean LATAM Airlines Group (LTM.SN), which has an extensive route network in Brazil, although it has also been offered up to 2 billion reais.  BNDES, Gol and LATAM declined to comment.  Brazil\u2019s airlines have been forced to ground most of their fleet due to the coronavirus pandemic, like their peers around the world.   BNDES will provide up to 60% of the amount, while private banks will contribute around 10%, with the remainder expected to come from institutional investors, the sources said, adding that the plan could still change.  Companies will receive the 75% of the funds by issuing 5-year bonds. They will be freed from making interest payments during the initial year. The remaining part of the rescue will come from the issuance of convertible debt.  BNDES, banks and investors in the rescue plan will gain a total return of up to Brazil\u2019s interbank benchmark rate plus 14% per year, the sources said. Still, those gains may change, depending on investors\u2019 appetite on the day of the pricing.  One of the sources added the rescue plan restricts airlines\u2019  dividends, compensation levels and how they use the funds.   BNDES is also in talks with local units of carmakers such as General Motors Co (GM.N), Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCHA.MI), Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) and Ford Motor Co (F.N) about potential aid, but the parties remain deadlocked over the question of collateral.  Carmakers have offered tax credits as collateral for the aid, but BNDES and banks are reluctant to take it, one of the sources said.

Nearly 90 million foreign tourists visited France in 2019, making it the world\u2019s most visited country, government data shows. Tourism accounts for almost 8% of the country\u2019s 2.3 trillion euro economy.  \u201cTourism is facing what is probably its worst challenge in modern history,\u201d Prime Minister Edouard Philippe told a news conference. \u201cBecause this is one of the crown jewels of the French economy, rescuing it is a national priority.\u201d  \u201cThis very French pleasure, which is at the heart of our identity, to meet up, eat well and have a chat, has been compromised by the lockdown first, and then the conditions of lifting that lockdown,\u201d Philippe said.  The prime minister said that with 95% of hotels closed, the government\u2019s priority was to avoid bankruptcies and job cuts.   To prevent job losses, the government is reimbursing companies for 70% of the gross wages of workers they put on furlough, and Philippe said that it will extend this measure until at least the end of September, even though the government is looking at winding down support down for other sectors.  In April, French hotels company Accor (ACCP.PA), which runs brands such as Ibis and Sofitel, said it was cutting spending and had placed the bulk of its staff on furlough or unemployment schemes.  Philippe said he hoped restaurants would be able to re-open on June 2 in the country\u2019s \u201cgreen zones\u201d where the virus is not circulating widely.  That would rule out an immediate return of the dining scene in Paris, a virus hotspot \u201cred zone\u201d.  The prime minister said the cherished summer holiday in July and August, when Paris virtually shuts down and holiday-makers head for beaches and country houses, would not be lost.  That, however, would require a relaxation of restrictions, including a ban on trips of more than 100 kilometres and the closure of beaches.  Solene Moisson, a student who was taking pictures in deserted Paris tourist hotspot, the Trocadero square, said escaping from Paris something she craved.  \u201cBeing able to see our families. Walk in the countryside, maybe go the beach if it\u2019s open. To leave Paris. Summer in Paris is stifling with not much to do. We need a change of scenery,\u201d she told Reuters.  An 88-year-old Parisian, who gave his name only as Albert, was more cautious.   \u201cI will go away only if it\u2019s possible, if there is no danger. If the virus is still a risk, I will not go,\u201d he said.   Measures outlined by Philippe to rescue the sector, which he said totalled a \u201cmassive and unprecedented\u201d 18 billion euros, included a 1.3 billion euros investment plan for direct cash injections into businesses by state banks.  Businesses with up to 20 employees and 2 million euros in annual revenue in the tourism, hotel and restaurant sector will also be able to tap a solidarity fund until the end of the year, to receive grants of up to 10,000 euros.  There will also be a social security tax break for May and June payments. The amnesty will continue as long as businesses have to remain shut. Tax exemptions will in total amount to 2 billion euros, Philippe said.

Reporting by Lisa Lambert; Editing by Chris Reese","69":"WASHINGTON\/LONDON (Reuters) - The Trump administration on Thursday issued guidelines to help ship owners and insurers avoid the risks of sanctions penalties, standards that maritime players and a senior State Department official said were modified following months of discussions with industry.  The guidelines, known as a Global Maritime Advisory, concern sanctions on Iran, North Korea and Syria. The State Department said that it is committed to disrupting sanctions evasion and smuggling of goods, including oil exports from Iran, which the Trump administration imposed sanctions on soon after pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal in 2018.     Global shippers and insurers had balked at an initial outline of the advisory that the State Department had previewed in March, arguing that it would have disrupted international trade with legal questions.  The senior State Department official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said talks with industry had occurred for months, adding that he and his team had held multiple meetings in London, Washington and other parts of the world with the industry so that the end document was not \u201cAmerica-centric.\u201d   \u201cWe have worked through several iterations of this document with industry and each iteration was an improvement upon the previous one,\u201d the official said. \u201cWe have an open line and ongoing dialogues with a range of industry representatives of this industry.\u201d  The Trump administration has ratcheted up its sanctions enforcement on countries like Iran and Venezuela, and has, for example, imposed penalties on a unit of Chinese shipping giant COSCO last year for transporting blacklisted crude. It said it will target intermediaries as well as ship-to-ship transfers.  The maritime advisory was first outlined on March 9 by David Peyman, a State Department deputy assistant secretary. He said then the advisory would, among other things, warn shippers not to turn off transponders and to not store Iranian oil.   Peyman has since left that role to take another job at the State Department, and Andrew Weinschenk is now an acting deputy assistant secretary of state for counter threat finance and sanctions.  A maritime source said the industry was concerned that parts of the original advisory plan, which encouraged ship captains to take photographs of parties conducting ship-to-ship transfers and make them available to the authorities, would have run into legal issues.    Insurers had also been concerned about initial guidelines on ship transponders, which some shippers of sanctioned oil have turned off in the past, but which also sometimes fail during  severe weather.    While the State Department incorporated changes over the last few months, industry still had concerns.   \u201cIt is important to recognize that the sectors of the maritime industry targeted by the guidance are often subject to complex domestic and international regulation that may impose conflicting requirements on a party,\u201d a maritime source said.
