High schools will reopen on June 2 and elementary schools will return to full schedules on June 8, Rutte said, detailing a decision by the Dutch government.  The easing will take place nearly two and a half months after lockdown measures were imposed across the country of 17 million in mid-March.  \u201cWe earned the space we are getting for sticking to the guidelines,\u201d Rutte said in a live television broadcast. \u201cWe have to stick to the rules because we know the virus can flare up again.\u201d  The number of infections from the novel coronavirus rose by 108 to 44,249 on Tuesday, with 21 new deaths over the last 24 hours.

People must keep 1.5 metres apart from others, unless they live together. Museums will also reopen, but tickets will only be sold online in advance to avoid crowds.  Homes for the elderly, where infection rates have been relatively high, will again allow visitors, with more widespread testing available to reduce risks.  Public transport will also resume regular schedules, with non-medical face masks compulsory for anyone over 13 years of age.

The one-year IMF programme would help with any payment gaps businesses face as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.   Repayment would be spread out over the medium term.  Hala Saeed told the American Chamber of Commerce in Egypt on a video conference that it would include financing from bilateral and multilateral sources.  In 2016, Egypt agreed a $12 billion, three-year Extended Fund Facility programme with the International Monetary Fund designed to reduce its fiscal and balance of payment deficits.    \u201cThe 2016 programme was more on the fiscal and monetary side,\u201d Saeed said. \u201cAfter the success of the first phase of reform, we are continuing the structural reform programme.\u201d    She said Egypt had already been working on structural reforms before the pandemic and had identified six priorities, including digital transformation, industry, agriculture and logistics.  Central bank deputy governor Rami Aboul Naga said last week  Egypt was in talks with the IMF for more financial support. When asked about a Bloomberg News report that Egypt would seek a further $5 billion from the IMF and $4 billion from other sources for a total of $9 billion, Naga told Al Arabiya news channel that the number was close to that figure.  The IMF last week had already approved one financing package for Egypt - a $2.77 billion Rapid Financing Instrument - to help Cairo close a gap in its balance of payments caused by the coronavirus outbreak.  Saeed said the economy grew by nearly 5% in the Jan-March quarter, down from 5.8% expected before the pandemic.  \u201cIt is 0.8 less than what we were aiming for, however, we are still positive with a high growth rate.\u201d   The government had been counting on the higher growth to help Egypt absorb the 750,000 to 850,000 workers who enter the labour market each year as well as part of the backlog in unemployment, she added.

The states said Santander violated consumer protection laws by placing borrowers with subprime credit\u00a0into auto loans it knew carried a high probability of default. Santander has agreed to pay $65 million for restitution for some customers and to waive deficiency balances on loans worth $478 million. It will also pay $7 million to the states to manage restitution claims.  Santander, the nation\u2019s largest subprime auto financing company and an arm of Spanish bank Banco Santander SA that went public in 2014, said it was pleased to resolve the investigation and \u201cno additional charges will be taken in connection with the settlement.\u201d  \u201cSantander profited by approving high-cost loans to disadvantaged auto buyers who were doomed from the start,\u201d\u00a0said California Attorney General Xavier Becerra in a statement.  California said Santander approved loans it expected would default at rates of greater than 70% and alleged \u201cSantander\u2019s aggressive pursuit of market share led it to underestimate the risk associated with loans by turning a blind eye to dealer abuse.\u201d  For some consumers who defaulted but have not had their cars repossessed, Santander is required to allow them to keep them and waive loan balances up to a total of $45 million and to waive deficiency balances on other loans totaling $433 million.    Santander agreed not to purchase loans where consumers would likely have no money left over monthly and not to require auto dealers to sell add-on \u201cback-end\u201d products to consumers.

Pier 1, which operates about 541 stores in the U.S., said in a statement that it intends to sell its inventory and remaining assets, including its intellectual property and e-commerce business, through a court-supervised process.  \u201cUnfortunately, the challenging retail environment has been significantly compounded by the profound impact of COVID-19, hindering our ability to secure such a buyer and requiring us to wind down,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Robert Riesbeck said.   Pier 1 said it will continue to serve its customers through its online operations, Pier1.com, and will start closing stores  and begin sales liquidation once stores can reopen based on COVID-19 guidelines from local government officials.  The company\u2019s debtor-in-possession financiers have agreed to allow the company to overdraw about $40 million to support operations through the wind-down period, it added.  The Fort Worth, Texas-based company had earlier in the year in February filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and was pursuing a sale, a month after announcing plans for up to 450 store closures and the shut down of two distribution centers.

Israel does not have diplomatic relations with any of the six Gulf Arab countries, and there are no commercial flights between them. It has relations with only two Arab countries: Egypt and Jordan.   However, shared concerns over Iran\u2019s influence in the region have led to a discrete thaw in ties between Israel and the Arab Gulf in recent years.   That thaw has been accompanied by a slight relaxation of stringent air travel rules. In 2018, Saudi Arabia opened its airspace for the first time to a commercial flight to Israel - an Air India route between New Delhi and Tel Aviv.   \u201cEtihad Airways operated a dedicated humanitarian cargo flight from Abu Dhabi to Tel Aviv on 19 May to provide medical supplies to the Palestinians,\u201d an Etihad spokeswoman said, adding that there were no passengers on board.  An official at Tel Aviv\u2019s Ben Gurion Airport said the flight would arrive at 9 p.m. (1900 GMT).   The United Nations coordinated a 14-tonne shipment of \u201curgent medical supplies\u201d from the UAE to help curb the spread of COVID-19 in the Palestinian territories, according to a statement from the United Nations Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process (UNSCO).  \u201cThe aid includes personal protective equipment (PPE) and medical equipment. Most notably, it includes 10 ventilators that are acutely needed,\u201d the statement added.  It was not immediately clear whether the 14 tonnes of aid were transported on the Tuesday Etihad cargo flight. Etihad was not mentioned in the UNSCO statement.  Palestinian officials in the Israeli-occupied West Bank had no immediate comment. Health officials in the Gaza Strip, which is ruled by the Islamist group Hamas, said they had no knowledge of any aid shipment for Gaza from Abu Dhabi.

In the biggest confidence booster, the Federal Reserve has bought $1.5 trillion in Treasuries since mid-March, hoping to stabilize the more than $17-trillion market after it seized up during the pandemic. It has been buying both short-term and long-term debt, but tapered purchases this week to a daily average of $6 billion, from $7 billion the previous week, as liquidity improved.  Treasury will initially offer $20 billion 20-year bonds and will sell a total of $54 billion over the next three months. The last 20-year was sold in 1986.  \u201cThere\u2019s demand for all bonds at this time because the Fed has created the backstop. They\u2019re the buyer of last resort,\u201d said Patrick Leary, chief market strategist, at Incapital.   Solid demand at last week\u2019s auction of U.S. three-year and 10-year notes, as well as 30-year bonds augured well for the 20-year bond sale.  \u201cI don\u2019t see any reason why the 20-year won\u2019t go just fine,\u201d Leary said.  All three auctions showed higher participation from indirect bidders including foreign central banks.  \u201cIf surging issuance leads to undesirably high term premiums at the long-end of the Treasury curve, the Fed will quickly ramp purchases back up to squash them,\u201d said Ryan Swift, U.S. bond strategist at BCA Research.  The auction could draw good interest from foreign investors. As the Fed cut U.S. interest rates to near zero, their costs have dropped for neutralizing currency exposure of owning dollar-denominated assets.   Prohibitive hedging costs had deterred some foreign investors in Europe and Japan from buying U.S. assets because returns eroded as dollars were converted back to their home currencies.   A Japanese investor buying U.S. 30-year Treasuries, would pick up a yield of 51 basis points, compared with 45 basis points when he purchases Japanese government bonds, according to Barclays data.  For a European investor, buying 30-year Treasuries shows a yield pick-up 48 basis points, and for UK investors, the yield is 117 basis points.  \u201cThe Japanese will buy the 20-year,\u201d said Zoltan Pozsar, managing director at Credit Suisse in New York. \u201cBuying the 10-year on a hedged-basis is profitable, but not that profitable, so the 20-year will price for a better yield.\u201d  Reporting by Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss; Editing by Alden Bentley and David Gregorio","6":"(Reuters) - Businesses will face weak demand as long as consumers and workers are worried about public health, and the unemployment rate is likely to stay in the double digits at the end of the year, Boston Federal Reserve Bank President Eric Rosengren said Tuesday.   The unemployment rate could peak at close to 20% as more Americans lose jobs in the shutdowns put in place across the country to limit the spread of the coronavirus, and the losses could linger, Rosengren said in remarks prepared for a webinar hosted by the New England Council.   \u201cUnfortunately, even by the end of the year, I expect the unemployment rate to remain at double-digit levels,\u201d he said.   Policymakers will take action to help reduce the length of time that people are out of work and some of the Fed\u2019s emergency lending facilities helped to ease the pressure in short-term funding markets, Rosengren said.    The Main Street Lending Facility, which aims to make credit available to small and medium sized businesses, should launch by the end of the month, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said on Tuesday.  Businesses that meet the requirements will be able to turn to their lenders for a loan, Rosengren said. However, the program will not help all businesses in need, he cautioned.   \u201cIt will not be able to assist everyone, but we expect that it will provide an important bridge for many businesses that employ much of the American workforce,\u201d Rosengren said.   As businesses reopen, many people will be nervous about returning to the workplace and demand for many services will stay low until those concerns are lifted, he said.   \u201cIn sum, simply allowing businesses to reopen is not a panacea,\u201d Rosengren said. \u201cPublic health solutions are paramount \u2013 without them, it will be virtually impossible to return to full employment.\u201d  Reporting by Jonnelle Marte; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama","7":"CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. farmers that grow crops such as corn or soybeans will receive coronavirus assistance payments based on either half of their 2019 production or the supplies they had on hand as of Jan. 15, the government said on Tuesday.

Reporting by Jamie McGeever","9":"GENEVA (Reuters) - The World Health Organization\u2019s head said on Tuesday he would keep leading the global fight against the coronavirus pandemic, after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to cut off funding and quit the body.  WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus defended the agency\u2019s role after the United States again withheld full support for a resolution on the pandemic.  \u201cWe want accountability more than anyone,\u201d Tedros told a virtual meeting of the WHO\u2019S 194 member states. \u201cWe will continue providing strategic leadership to coordinate the global response.\u201d  Washington allowed the resolution calling for a review into the global response to the pandemic to pass by consensus, but said it objected to language about reproductive health rights and permission for poor countries to waive patent rules.  WHO officials running the meeting clapped and cheered after the resolution was passed without a vote hours after Trump tweeted his threat to pull the United States out of the body.  It calls for a review into the WHO-led global response, something the United States has demanded.  But the U.S. mission in Geneva said in a statement that paragraphs on the right of poor countries to waive patents to obtain medicine during a health emergency would \u201csend the wrong message to innovators\u201d trying to produce new drugs and vaccines.  The reproductive healthcare language could be interpreted as requiring countries to permit abortion. \u201cThe United States believes in legal protections for the unborn,\u201d it said.  China and the United States also sparred in the closing moments of the assembly over the issue of Taiwan. Taiwan lobbied hard to be included as an observer at the two-day meeting and received support from the United States, Japan and others, but says it was not invited due to opposition from China.  Even as Trump has proposed quitting the WHO, the body has received backing and a two-year pledge of $2 billion in funds from China\u2019s President Xi Jinping.  Many other leaders expressed support for Tedros.  European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called for international cooperation in response to the pandemic.  \u201cAt times like these, the greatest act of courage is to play as a team,\u201d she continued, without an overt reference to the United States.  During his three years in office, Trump has criticised many international organisations and quit some. Still, European diplomats said they were taken aback by Washington\u2019s decision to stand aside at the WHO while China is boosting its role.  \u201cIt was so striking to see Xi Jinping seizing the opportunity to open up, with broad (cooperation), and make a proposal for $2 billion, and say if ever there is a vaccine they will share it with everyone,\u201d a European diplomat said.  \u201cIt\u2019s exactly what we feared: the space liberated by Washington will be taken up by China.\u201d  The WHO declined to comment on Trump\u2019s threat to quit, saying only that it had received his letter and was considering its contents.  Tuesday\u2019s resolution calls for a review into how the novel coronavirus spread after making the jump from animals to humans, believed to have happened in the Chinese city of Wuhan last year.   Some countries including hard-hit Spain and Italy suggested the body could emerge stronger from the pandemic through reform.  \u201cThis should be a time for renewing our organisation and we renew our strong commitment to the organisation,\u201d Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said.

Yates claimed to employ over 400 people, although in reality \u201cno employees worked for his purported business,\u201d prosecutors said in a statement.  \u201cThis defendant allegedly sought to steal millions of dollars in loans intended to aid legitimate small businesses grappling with the economic effects of COVID-19\u201d, the respiratory disease caused by the new coronavirus, said Brian Benczkowski, head of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division.\u00a0   Prosecutors said charges Yates faces include violating statutes relating to wire fraud, bank fraud, making false statements to a financial institution and making false statements to the SBA.

Telephones rang incessantly in hairdresser salons, as unkempt clients rushed to make themselves more presentable.  \u201cI already have 150 appointments, all very urgent, all of them insisting that they must be first on the list,\u201d said Stefania Ziggiotto, a hairdresser in the Alpine resort of Courmayeur. \u201cI have a full agenda for three weeks.\u201d  However, many business owners worried that the reopening might not magic away their many problems, with lingering fears of the coronavirus keeping many Italians at home, while foreign tourists, vital for the economy, were utterly absent.  The government has said it will open up Italy\u2019s borders with Europe and allow free travel between the regions from June 3, but no-one expects a sudden influx of outsiders.  Monica Robaldo, owner of the Pierre Alexis 1877 restaurant in Courmayeur, said she would not reopen before the end of May.  \u201cWe have a loyal clientele ... mostly tourists, so while travel between the regions and from abroad is not allowed, there is not much point in reopening,\u201d she said.  The Treasury is predicting the economy will contract by at least 8% in 2020, the deepest recession since World War Two, and Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said at the weekend he was taking a \u201ccalculated risk\u201d in rolling back the rigid curbs.  Although there was noticeably more traffic on the roads of major cities on Monday morning, some people appeared hesitant to resume their old habits.  Angelo Lombardo, owner of Cocco Caffe in the northern city of Bologna, is allowed to serve a maximum four customers at any one time, but he said he wasn\u2019t having to worry about social distancing rules at present.  \u201cA lot of people are just walking past and looking in from outside wondering whether they can come in or not,\u201d he said, criticising the government for doing too little to explain how the rules had changed.  \u201cLet\u2019s give it time,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the first day.\u201d  Reporting by Crispian Balmer, Giulio Piovaccari; Stephen Jewkes and Gabriele Pileri; Editing by Nick Macfie","16":"OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada and the United States have agreed to extend a ban on non-essential travel between the two nations by another 30 days as part of the fight against the coronavirus, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Tuesday.  U.S. and Canadian officials had said last week it was likely the measure would be rolled over until June 21.   \u201cThis is an important decision that will keep people in both of our countries safe,\u201d Trudeau told reporters. The ban, initially introduced in mid-March, had already been extended in April until May 21.  U.S. officials were not immediately available for comment.  Bilateral relations have steadily improved since a low point in June 2018, when U.S. President Donald Trump accused Trudeau of being weak after a Group of Seven summit.  Trump though said on Tuesday that Washington should consider terminating trade deals under which it imports cattle as it looks to help domestic producers. A new free trade agreement between the United States, Canada and Mexico comes into effect on July 1.  Canadian officials were not immediately available for comment. Canada exported $2.75 billion worth of beef in 2018, 74% of it to the United States, according to the Canadian Cattlemen\u2019s Association lobby group.  The temporary ban on non-essential travel does not cover trade across a border that stretches 5,525 miles (8,891 km). Canada sends 75% of all goods exports to the United States.  Trudeau said Canada\u2019s 10 provinces had made it clear they wanted the measures to be rolled over.  When non-essential travel restarted, Canada would need \u201cto have strong measures in place\u201d, he said, but gave no details.     Canada\u2019s total death toll from the outbreak edged up by less than 1% to 5,857 from 5,805 on Monday, easily the lowest daily increase since the crisis started, official data showed.

Powell and Mnuchin were testifying to the Senate Banking Committee as Congress considers whether to roll out trillions of dollars of additional aid to bolster an economy that was brought to a virtual standstill by lockdowns imposed in March and April.  The Trump administration has been criticized for initially downplaying the pandemic, which has now killed more than 90,000 Americans, and not ensuring that enough medical supplies were in place to battle the virus.  Essential workers \u201cput their lives on the line for very low wages, and they\u2019re still worried about paying their bills. Is that fair?,\u201d Sherrod Brown, a Democratic senator from Ohio, asked Mnuchin.   When Mnuchin started to thank \u201call the essential workers,\u201d Brown interrupted him. \u201cThanking is great, but is it fair our economy pays the essential workers so little in such work conditions?\u201d   Senators are also expected to have sharp questions about the additional actions needed to keep the world's largest economy afloat, and missteps in rolling out some $3 trillion in aid so far. (See graphic here showing how the money moved.)  The hearing https:\/\/www.banking.senate.gov started at 10 a.m. (1400 GMT) and was expected to last two hours.    As more states reopen businesses, the government is closing in on the end of an eight-week program to funnel money to small businesses to avoid layoffs, prompting calls to extend the $660 billion Paycheck Protection Program. President Donald Trump said on Monday that such an extension \u201cshould be easy.\u201d  Fiscal relief so far has been lopsided, with big banks getting easy access to Fed backstops, but mom-and-pop businesses initially shut out of paycheck lending programs. Meanwhile, some of the country\u2019s lowest-paid workers are doing the most dangerous jobs.  While over 30 million unemployment claims have been processed since March, workers are reporting delays of weeks or months in getting checks, with others saying they are locked out here of claiming benefits.   Mnuchin, in written testimony published on Tuesday, said he sees high unemployment during the second quarter, but that the overall situation is expected to improve as the economy starts to reopen.  \u201cWorking closely with governors, we are beginning to open the economy in a way that minimizes risks to workers and customers,\u201d Mnuchin said. \u201cWe expect economic conditions to improve in the third and fourth quarters.\u201d  Powell, in prepared remarks for the hearing, said the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act passed in March was \u201ccritical\u201d to the U.S. central bank\u2019s ability to expand credit throughout the economy to offset the blow from the coronavirus.  Other programs aimed at helping larger companies and municipal bond issuers through a sharp recession are just getting started.  The U.S. central bank has slashed interest rates to near zero and set up a broad network of programs to ensure financial markets continue to function during the pandemic. It has also established precedent-setting lending facilities for companies and the first-ever corporate bond purchases.  In remarks broadcast on Sunday night, Powell said  unemployment may hit 25% before it begins to fall, with a contraction in gross domestic product of 20% or more. He added that positive \u201cmedical metrics\u201d that can build consumer confidence would be critical.      Senators are also likely to try to elicit the two officials\u2019 views on the $3 trillion aid bill crafted by Democrats in the House of Representatives. It narrowly passed the Democratic-controlled chamber on Friday, but is opposed by Republicans in the Republican-controlled Senate.  Before the hearing on Tuesday, Mnuchin met with Vice President Mike Pence, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy at the U.S. Capitol, according to the White House.   Mnuchin also will face questions by the Senate banking panel over processing glitches that held up small-business loan applications as the Paycheck Protection Program was rushed into service in early April, as well as on abrupt policy changes that required many larger, publicly traded restaurant chains with access to capital markets to return their funds under the threat of audits.  A separate congressional oversight board issued its first report here on the response, consisting largely of questions that could be asked in Tuesday's hearing.  Among them are how the agencies will measure success and isolate the effects of the measures from other state and federal efforts.

Some businesses have expressed concerns that under the \u201cPaycheck Protection Program\u201d they have been unable to use the loan money within an eight-week time frame.   McCarthy raised the possibility of extending the time limit to 10 or 12 weeks. If borrowers meet conditions of the loans, they are converted to grants.  He said an extension would be appropriate because \u201ca number of states have been shut down longer.\u201d Representatives for the restaurant industry had pressed President Donald Trump on Monday for a 24-week repayment period.  On Friday, the House of Representatives approved a $3 trillion bill pushed by Democrats as a next step in Washington\u2019s response to the coronavirus pandemic. Its passage was expected to kick off a new round of negotiations involving the White House and Congress.  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, has not embraced an additional infusion of federal funding, on top of the approximately $3 trillion already enacted. Instead, he is pushing for new protections for businesses from liability lawsuits as they reopen after weeks of being shut due to the highly contagious coronavirus.  Nevertheless, a group of Senate Democrats and Republicans on Monday signed onto a bill that would establish a $500 billion fund to help state and local governments, whose revenues are being severely curtailed by the closing of the U.S. economy in March.  Some lawmakers also have discussed the need to revise unemployment insurance provisions with the national jobless rate spiking to 14.7 percent in April.

The girls were killed last week in the deeply conservative  and war-torn northwestern area of North Waziristan in what police suspect was an act of \u201chonour killing\u201d.   Police say the video which they believe prompted the girls\u2019 murder was shot a year ago but had only recently been uploaded on social media.    \u201cThe females were sisters, identified as Jasima Bibi and Saeeda Bibi,\u201d North Waziristan police chief Shafiullah Gandapur told Reuters.  Their family had been displaced by a military operation against militants in their hometown, he said.      He said the man who was filmed kissing them in a 44-second video was arrested on Monday together with a friend who police believe uploaded the video, but police believe the murder suspect fled to Karachi, Pakistan\u2019s largest city.  Police also said the girls\u2019 father and uncle had been arrested on suspicion of concealing the murder and evidence.  The killing is the first high-profile criminal case to be pursued in the formerly autonomous tribal region, where ultra-conservative customs present a big challenge for police.  Pakistan extended police jurisdiction to the area in 2018, ending more than a century of relatively autonomous rule in a region used by Taliban and al Qaeda militants to launch attacks in Pakistan and neighbouring Afghanistan. \u00a0  Police said the girls\u2019 relatives and local residents did not want a case registered because of \u201clocal traditions\u201d, so the police became the complainant in the case.  Thousands of incidents of violence against women perceived to have \u201cdamaged\u201d family honour are reported in Pakistan each year and many more go unreported, rights groups say. Pakistan enacted legislation to protect against \u201chonour killings\u201d in 2016.

In a decision dated May 18 and seen by Reuters, the judge said the April 29 order by market regulator CENACE risked distorting free competition to the detriment of the consumer, and Mexico\u2019s commitments to promote a clean environment.  CENACE suspended the plants, arguing that the intermittency of wind and solar power threatened the reliability of the national power supply during the coronavirus crisis.  However, after several suits were filed to contest that suspension, the judge found that the risks cited by CENACE were less serious than the implications of undermining competition and jeopardizing Mexico\u2019s transition towards clean energy.  On Friday, both Canada and the European Union wrote letters to the government complaining about the CENACE\u2019s move, asking for an audience with Energy Minister Rocio Nahle. Nahle said on Monday she would respond to their concerns this week.  Late on Friday, her ministry published an order that gives the government more scope to control the process of approving new renewable energy projects, further angering those who feel the administration is squeezing out private companies.  President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, a leftist who is intent on giving the state a bigger role in the energy sector, on Monday rejected criticism of the government\u2019s agenda.  He said he wanted to level the playing field in a sector that for too long had been beholden to private interests.  Asked for comment by Reuters, Mexico\u2019s Federal Economic Competition Commission (Cofece) said it was studying the orders issued by CENACE and the energy ministry, and would make a determination on them if it decided to open an investigation.

(Reuters) - When a senior living facility in Amarillo, Texas suspected a nurse may have caught the novel coronavirus this month, it had a list within five minutes of staff and residents the nurse could have infected.   High-tech wristbands worn by The Legacy at Town Square\u2019s 35 workers and 49 residents expedited contact tracing, the otherwise pain-staking process of interviewing patients to determine who crossed paths with them.   The nurse tested negative an hour later and Legacy did not have to isolate or test others. But its experience shows how wristbands and other wearables have emerged as tools to automatically record encounters between people at places that can mandate their use.  Facilities with quick contact tracing following infections in the coming months will be better positioned to ward off outbreaks and stay open, according to epidemiologists.  \u201cIt makes you ready to make the best operational decisions at a moment\u2019s notice,\u201d said Joseph Walter, executive director at LifeWell Senior Living\u2019s Legacy facility.  Australia, Singapore and other governments have sought to enable smartphones to record people\u2019s contacts. But data privacy rules imposed by smartphone software makers Apple Inc and Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google limit the utility of smartphone-based systems, while many employers do not let workers carry phones because of security and safety considerations.  Manufacturers are hawking wearables online priced as low as $4.    The Legacy in Texas uses technology from CarePredict, a startup that added contact tracing functionality to its system for elderly care homes when the pandemic struck.   CarePredict\u2019s Tempo bracelets function as a call button to summon staff, a digital room key, and a health and activity tracker. More than 20 care facilities in the United States have the devices, which cost about $1 per day per user, according to CarePredict.    The wristbands use infrared light to connect to beacons on a wall in each room, creating a record of who has been near whom, where and for how long.   Walter said the system has proved accurate over the last two years for tracking residents\u2019 activities at The Legacy, but its reliability in contact tracing is yet to be seen.    Setting up beacons and special-purpose devices like CarePredict\u2019s Tempo may be too costly and complex for some facilities. But wearables that communicate with each other through Bluetooth signals may be more suitable, and software development company Myplanet and automaker Ford Motor Co are among those testing popular Bluetooth-based fitness trackers and smartwatches from companies such as Fitbit Inc and Samsung Electronics Co.   One of Myplanet\u2019s experiments found that companies hoping to reduce costs and hassles by allowing workers to use existing gadgets will face connection challenges because of variances in the devices\u2019 Bluetooth technology, said Greg Fields, who is leading the Toronto-based firm\u2019s contact tracing efforts for its multinational clients.  Apple and Google soon plan to release contact tracing technology to smooth out some of the connection issues on phones, and device makers are confident that the tech giants will do the same for wearables, said David Su, CEO at Atmosic, a Silicon Valley-based wireless chip company.   The companies did not respond to requests for comment on the speculation. While Apple-Google technology would improve reliability in contact tracing, devices that use it would need access to the internet and a government-authorized contact tracing app.  Ford conducted a small test of pricey smartwatches that alert wearers when they are standing closer than guidelines allow, but they too require Wi-Fi, which is sometimes unavailable in sprawling plants, Ford manufacturing chief Gary Johnson told Reuters.   The automaker also is testing chips on identification badges, he said, and those could track sustained encounters or issue reminders to keep distance.

On Monday, Sao Paulo Governor Joao Doria and Mayor Bruno Covas said they were working to turn Wednesday, Thursday and Monday into holidays, with Friday a day off at the discretion of employers.  The holidays they are moving are: the Roman Catholic feast of Corpus Christi, normally on June 11; Consci\u00eancia Negra, a Black Awarenss holiday normally celebrated on Nov. 20, and  Constitutional Revolution Day, normally celebrated July 9.  Eleven financial industry associations, including Brazilian banking lobby Febraban, also wrote to Doria expressing concern about advancing the holidays, according to a copy of the document seen by Reuters.   The governor\u2019s office said it had not received the letter. Febraban and the mayor\u2019s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  On Monday, Doria and Covas said they were taking the emergency measure to increase social isolation, pointing to data that showed more people stayed at home on recent weekends and holidays.  Brazil\u2019s coronavirus outbreak has exploded in recent weeks, with more than 250,000 confirmed cases, third-highest in the world, and nearly 17,000 fatalities. The city and state of Sao Paulo are at the epicenter, with about a quarter of the country\u2019s deaths and diagnoses.

In a sometimes testy hearing before the Senate Banking Committee, Mnuchin and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the nearly $3 trillion in coronavirus rescue programs rolled out by the federal government over the past two months were working to support an economy devastated by the novel coronavirus.  But the Treasury and Fed chiefs faced tough questions over whether the administration\u2019s plans to quickly reopen the economy in the wake of lockdowns imposed in March and April would leave low-wage workers without adequate protections from the virus.  Congress is considering legislation that would free up trillions of dollars of additional aid to further bolster the economy, help states and increase pay for essential workers who are doing some of the most dangerous jobs.  President Donald Trump has been criticized for initially downplaying the pandemic, which has now killed more than 90,000 Americans, and not ensuring that enough medical supplies were in place to battle the virus.  \u201cHow many workers should give their lives to increase the GDP or the Dow Jones by 1,000 points?\u201d asked Senator Sherrod Brown, the committee\u2019s top Democrat.  \u201cNo workers should give their lives to do that, senator, and I think your characterization is unfair. We have provided enormous amounts of equipment,\u201d Mnuchin replied.  Mnuchin said he wanted to thank \u201call the essential workers,\u201d but Brown interrupted him, adding, \u201cThanking is great, but is it fair our economy pays the essential workers so little in such work conditions?\u201d  Powell said new Treasury-backed Fed lending programs aimed at mid-size companies and municipal bond markets would be up and running by the beginning of June. Only a \u201cfairly modest\u201d amount of money has gone out through the Fed credit programs so far.  The U.S. central bank has slashed interest rates to near zero and set up a broad network of programs to ensure financial markets continue to function during the pandemic. It has also established precedent-setting lending facilities for companies and the first-ever corporate bond purchases.  Initial recipients of the $660 billion Paycheck Protection Program, which provides forgivable loans to small businesses, are nearing the end of their 8-week loan terms, and calls by senators for extensions increased during Tuesday\u2019s hearing.  Mnuchin said he hoped to reach a bipartisan agreement  \u201ctechnical fix\u201d that would extend the loans.  \u201cCompanies are really having issues with not necessarily being able to use it within those 8 weeks. They don\u2019t want more money, they want flexibility that they can use it in longer than an 8-week period,\u201d Mnuchin said.  Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat, also pressed Mnuchin on why participants in the \u201chalf-a-trillion-dollar slush fund\u201d supporting the \u201cMain Street\u201d lending program and Fed credit facilities aimed at larger borrowers have no specific requirements to retain employees.  Mnuchin said such terms were \u201cdiscussed with people on both sides of the aisle\u201d as the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act was being negotiated in March.  (See graphic here showing CARES Act money flows.)  Mnuchin also said that Treasury\u2019s base-case analysis showed at least some capital losses on the Fed loan programs were expected, but that there could be instances where the Treasury earned a return on its capital. Under the most optimistic scenario, markets would fully recover and the Fed facilities would not be needed, he added.  While more than 30 million unemployment claims have been processed since March, workers are reporting delays of weeks or months in getting checks, with others saying they are locked out here of claiming benefits.   Mnuchin also said he sees more job losses in the next month before the economy starts to improve.  \u201cWorking closely with governors, we are beginning to open the economy in a way that minimizes risks to workers and customers,\u201d Mnuchin said. \u201cWe expect economic conditions to improve in the third and fourth quarters.\u201d  Although the hearing was held by videoconference, Mnuchin met with Vice President Mike Pence, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy at the U.S. Capitol, according to the White House.

Thabane\u2019s departure marks the end of one of Lesotho\u2019s longest political careers, one marked by exile, intrigue, tensions with the military and a political crisis that deepened when police named him as a murder suspect in February.  \u201cThe time to retire from the great theatre of action, take leave from public life and office has finally arrived,\u201d the 80-year-old Thabane told citizens in a speech on Lesotho TV.   His own All Basotho Convention (ABC) party, opposition figures and South African mediators had all been pressing Thabane to resign over the murder case.  Gunmen shot dead his previous wife, Lipolelo, on June 14, 2017, two days before he took office.  Maesaiah has been formally charged with the murder. Though named as a suspect, Thabane has not been charged. They both deny any involvement.  Lawmakers have said Thabane was not offered immunity from prosecution in return for stepping down, and it remains unclear whether he will now face any charges.  Finance Minister Moeketsi Majoro, named by parliament as Thabane\u2019s replacement, is expected to be sworn in on Wednesday.  \u201cI plead with the entire nation... to give my successor utmost support, and for my part I wish to assure him of my support,\u201d Thabane said in his televised address.

The authorities\u2019 task to save lives was complicated by ongoing efforts to curb the coronavirus pandemic and enforce social distancing to avoid a surge of infections. Many thousands of migrant workers are on the roads trying to get home from big cities after a nationwide lockdown destroyed their livelihoods.  Approaching from the Bay of Bengal, super cyclone Amphan was expected to hit the coast of eastern India and southern Bangladesh with winds gusting up to 185 kmh (115 mph) - the equivalent of a category 5 hurricane.  The Indian weather department forecast a storm surge of 10- to 16-foot waves - as high as a two-storey house - that could swamp mud dwellings along the coast, uproot communication towers and inundate roads and rail tracks.   There will be extensive damage to standing crops and plantations in the states of West Bengal and Odisha while large boats and ships could get torn from their moorings, the weather service said in a bulletin late on Tuesday.  Authorities were hastily repurposing quarantine facilities for the looming cyclone soon after easing the world\u2019s biggest lockdown against the virus, which in India is reported to have infected more than 100,000 people and killed 3,163.  Railway officials diverted away from the cyclone\u2019s path a number of trains carrying thousands of migrant workers to eastern states from the capital New Delhi where they had lost their jobs due to coronavirus lockdowns.  \u201cWe have just about six hours left to evacuate people from their homes and we also have to maintain social distancing norms,\u201d disaster management official S.G. Rai told Reuters.  \u201cThe cyclone could wash away thousands of huts and standing crops.\u201d   About 300,000 people had been moved to storm shelters, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee said. The state capital Kolkata lies near the cyclone\u2019s path and there was concern about people living in about 1,500 old, dilapidated buildings.  Neighbouring Bangladesh, where the cyclone posed a devastating threat along a low-lying, marshy coast, was shifting hundreds of thousands of people to higher ground. Bangladeshi authorities were also urging use of masks against the virus, which has caused 20,995 infections and 314 deaths.  \u201cWe have taken necessary steps so that people can maintain distance and wear masks,\u201d said Enamur Rahman, the junior minister for disaster management. He said 12,000 cyclone shelters were set up to accommodate more than 5 million people.   Bangladeshi officials said the cyclone could set off tidal waves and heavy rainfall, unleashing floods.  It was expected to hit land between the districts of Chittagong and Khulna, just 150 km (93 miles) from refugee camps housing more than a million Rohingya in flimsy shelters.  Aid workers have stockpiled emergency items such as food, tarpaulins and water purification tablets.   \u201cWe are really very worried,\u201d said Haiko Magtrayo, a worker of the International Committee of the Red Cross based in the nearby town of Cox\u2019s Bazar.

The most populous Arab country will bring forward the start of its curfew by four hours to 5 p.m. and halt public transport from May 24 for six days during the Eid holiday, as it seeks to curb the spread of the new coronavirus, Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly said on Sunday.

Minister of Basic Education Angie Motshekga said that, under strict social distancing rules, other grades would be able to attend lessons in smaller schools with fewer than 150 pupils.   Bigger schools will open for other grades at a later date.  South Africa, the African nation worst hit by COVID-19 with 16,433 infections and 286 deaths, began a phased easing of its lockdown at the start of May.  All teachers are expected to return to work from May 25 and the revised school calendar will be published soon, the minister said, adding that school sports would not be permitted.  \u201cWhen class is dismissed, learners must go home,\u201d she said.  Some parents and teachers have raised concerns about risks to their health and that of their children, urging the department to make sure that schools are properly supplied with personal protective equipment, sanitisers and temperature scanners.  The closure of schools halted a national feeding programme providing meals to 9 million extremely poor children, which Motshekga would resume on June 1.

Deaths in hospitals were up by 125 or 0.7% to 17,714 but the casualty count in nursing homes was revised downwards by 342 or 3.2% to 10,308 as the ministry adjusted data reported by regional health centers, a ministry official said.   The number of confirmed cases increased by 524 to 143,427, an increase of 0.4%, slightly higher than the average 0.3% rise per day seen since the end of lockdown on May 11. On Monday, the number of cases rose by 483.

The British company, which employs 600,000 globally and serves daily meals to hundreds of thousands of schoolkids, office workers and prisoners, has been forced to close more than half its businesses as lockdowns took hold globally.   Its sale of 195 million new shares at 1,025 pence each was the latest move to ease pressure on its finances and came at a discount of 11.1% to Monday\u2019s closing stock market prices.   That, allied to results that showed sales down 46% in April and profits falling, knocked as much as 11% off the market value of its shares on Tuesday before a late recovery. The company is now worth more than 40% less than it was in January.  Chief Executive Dominic Blakemore told Reuters that longer periods of physical distancing, school closures and working from home threatened to reduce the number of customers Compass serves.  \u201cThe equity placing is really the last piece of the puzzle ... to give us the resilience to weather whatever this crisis looks like over the next 12 to 18 months,\u201d he said.   \u201cIt may be a slightly smaller business, our job is to ensure that we\u2019ve got a profitable smaller business.\u201d  The company did nod in the direction of using the funds to invest in expansion into profitable areas at a time when smaller firms are struggling to survive, but analysts largely read the move as defensive.   Citi analyst James Ainley said the company\u2019s own scenarios pointed to a \u201cbearish outlook\u201d for 2021, with management expecting to be back within its target revenue range only by 2022.
