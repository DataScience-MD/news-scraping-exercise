High schools will reopen on June 2 and elementary schools will return to full schedules on June 8, Rutte said, detailing a decision by the Dutch government.  The easing will take place nearly two and a half months after lockdown measures were imposed across the country of 17 million in mid-March.  \u201cWe earned the space we are getting for sticking to the guidelines,\u201d Rutte said in a live television broadcast. \u201cWe have to stick to the rules because we know the virus can flare up again.\u201d  The number of infections from the novel coronavirus rose by 108 to 44,249 on Tuesday, with 21 new deaths over the last 24 hours. The death toll stood at 5,715, national health authorities said.   Cafes and restaurants will be permitted to open on June 1, with a maximum of 30 guests, Rutte said. People must keep 1.5 metres apart from others, unless they live together. Museums will also reopen, but tickets will only be sold online in advance to avoid crowds.  Homes for the elderly, where infection rates have been relatively high, will again allow visitors, with more widespread testing available to reduce risks.  Public transport will also resume regular schedules, with non-medical face masks compulsory for anyone over 13 years of age. Only essential travel will be allowed and less than half of seats will be available.  Gyms and dance venues will remain closed and large sporting events banned, probably until Sept. 1.

The one-year IMF programme would help with any payment gaps businesses face as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.   Repayment would be spread out over the medium term.  Hala Saeed told the American Chamber of Commerce in Egypt on a video conference that it would include financing from bilateral and multilateral sources.  In 2016, Egypt agreed a $12 billion, three-year Extended Fund Facility programme with the International Monetary Fund designed to reduce its fiscal and balance of payment deficits.    \u201cThe 2016 programme was more on the fiscal and monetary side,\u201d Saeed said. \u201cAfter the success of the first phase of reform, we are continuing the structural reform programme.\u201d    She said Egypt had already been working on structural reforms before the pandemic and had identified six priorities, including digital transformation, industry, agriculture and logistics.  Central bank deputy governor Rami Aboul Naga said last week  Egypt was in talks with the IMF for more financial support. When asked about a Bloomberg News report that Egypt would seek a further $5 billion from the IMF and $4 billion from other sources for a total of $9 billion, Naga told Al Arabiya news channel that the number was close to that figure.  The IMF last week had already approved one financing package for Egypt - a $2.77 billion Rapid Financing Instrument - to help Cairo close a gap in its balance of payments caused by the coronavirus outbreak.  Saeed said the economy grew by nearly 5% in the Jan-March quarter, down from 5.8% expected before the pandemic.  \u201cIt is 0.8 less than what we were aiming for, however, we are still positive with a high growth rate.\u201d   The government had been counting on the higher growth to help Egypt absorb the 750,000 to 850,000 workers who enter the labour market each year as well as part of the backlog in unemployment, she added.

The states said Santander violated consumer protection laws by placing borrowers with subprime credit\u00a0into auto loans it knew carried a high probability of default. Santander has agreed to pay $65 million for restitution for some customers and to waive deficiency balances on loans worth $478 million. It will also pay $7 million to the states to manage restitution claims.  Santander, the nation\u2019s largest subprime auto financing company and an arm of Spanish bank Banco Santander SA that went public in 2014, said it was pleased to resolve the investigation and \u201cno additional charges will be taken in connection with the settlement.\u201d  \u201cSantander profited by approving high-cost loans to disadvantaged auto buyers who were doomed from the start,\u201d\u00a0said California Attorney General Xavier Becerra in a statement.  California said Santander approved loans it expected would default at rates of greater than 70% and alleged \u201cSantander\u2019s aggressive pursuit of market share led it to underestimate the risk associated with loans by turning a blind eye to dealer abuse.\u201d  For some consumers who defaulted but have not had their cars repossessed, Santander is required to allow them to keep them and waive loan balances up to a total of $45 million and to waive deficiency balances on other loans totaling $433 million.    Santander agreed not to purchase loans where consumers would likely have no money left over monthly and not to require auto dealers to sell add-on \u201cback-end\u201d products to consumers.

Pier 1, which operates about 541 stores in the U.S., said in a statement that it intends to sell its inventory and remaining assets, including its intellectual property and e-commerce business, through a court-supervised process.  \u201cUnfortunately, the challenging retail environment has been significantly compounded by the profound impact of COVID-19, hindering our ability to secure such a buyer and requiring us to wind down,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Robert Riesbeck said.   Pier 1 said it will continue to serve its customers through its online operations, Pier1.com, and will start closing stores  and begin sales liquidation once stores can reopen based on COVID-19 guidelines from local government officials.  The company\u2019s debtor-in-possession financiers have agreed to allow the company to overdraw about $40 million to support operations through the wind-down period, it added.

Israel does not have diplomatic relations with any of the six Gulf Arab countries, and there are no commercial flights between them. It has relations with only two Arab countries: Egypt and Jordan.   However, shared concerns over Iran\u2019s influence in the region have led to a discrete thaw in ties between Israel and the Arab Gulf in recent years.   That thaw has been accompanied by a slight relaxation of stringent air travel rules. In 2018, Saudi Arabia opened its airspace for the first time to a commercial flight to Israel - an Air India route between New Delhi and Tel Aviv.   \u201cEtihad Airways operated a dedicated humanitarian cargo flight from Abu Dhabi to Tel Aviv on 19 May to provide medical supplies to the Palestinians,\u201d an Etihad spokeswoman said, adding that there were no passengers on board.  An official at Tel Aviv\u2019s Ben Gurion Airport said the flight would arrive at 9 p.m. (1900 GMT).   The United Nations coordinated a 14-tonne shipment of \u201curgent medical supplies\u201d from the UAE to help curb the spread of COVID-19 in the Palestinian territories, according to a statement from the United Nations Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process (UNSCO).  \u201cThe aid includes personal protective equipment (PPE) and medical equipment. Most notably, it includes 10 ventilators that are acutely needed,\u201d the statement added.  It was not immediately clear whether the 14 tonnes of aid were transported on the Tuesday Etihad cargo flight. Etihad was not mentioned in the UNSCO statement.

In the biggest confidence booster, the Federal Reserve has bought $1.5 trillion in Treasuries since mid-March, hoping to stabilize the more than $17-trillion market after it seized up during the pandemic. It has been buying both short-term and long-term debt, but tapered purchases this week to a daily average of $6 billion, from $7 billion the previous week, as liquidity improved.  Treasury will initially offer $20 billion 20-year bonds and will sell a total of $54 billion over the next three months. The last 20-year was sold in 1986.  \u201cThere\u2019s demand for all bonds at this time because the Fed has created the backstop. They\u2019re the buyer of last resort,\u201d said Patrick Leary, chief market strategist, at Incapital.   Solid demand at last week\u2019s auction of U.S. three-year and 10-year notes, as well as 30-year bonds augured well for the 20-year bond sale.  \u201cI don\u2019t see any reason why the 20-year won\u2019t go just fine,\u201d Leary said.  All three auctions showed higher participation from indirect bidders including foreign central banks.  \u201cIf surging issuance leads to undesirably high term premiums at the long-end of the Treasury curve, the Fed will quickly ramp purchases back up to squash them,\u201d said Ryan Swift, U.S. bond strategist at BCA Research.  The auction could draw good interest from foreign investors. As the Fed cut U.S. interest rates to near zero, their costs have dropped for neutralizing currency exposure of owning dollar-denominated assets.   Prohibitive hedging costs had deterred some foreign investors in Europe and Japan from buying U.S. assets because returns eroded as dollars were converted back to their home currencies.   A Japanese investor buying U.S. 30-year Treasuries, would pick up a yield of 51 basis points, compared with 45 basis points when he purchases Japanese government bonds, according to Barclays data.  For a European investor, buying 30-year Treasuries shows a yield pick-up 48 basis points, and for UK investors, the yield is 117 basis points.  \u201cThe Japanese will buy the 20-year,\u201d said Zoltan Pozsar, managing director at Credit Suisse in New York. \u201cBuying the 10-year on a hedged-basis is profitable, but not that profitable, so the 20-year will price for a better yield.\u201d  Reporting by Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss; Editing by Alden Bentley and David Gregorio","6":"(Reuters) - Businesses will face weak demand as long as consumers and workers are worried about public health, and the unemployment rate is likely to stay in the double digits at the end of the year, Boston Federal Reserve Bank President Eric Rosengren said Tuesday.   The unemployment rate could peak at close to 20% as more Americans lose jobs in the shutdowns put in place across the country to limit the spread of the coronavirus, and the losses could linger, Rosengren said in remarks prepared for a webinar hosted by the New England Council.   \u201cUnfortunately, even by the end of the year, I expect the unemployment rate to remain at double-digit levels,\u201d he said.   Policymakers will take action to help reduce the length of time that people are out of work and some of the Fed\u2019s emergency lending facilities helped to ease the pressure in short-term funding markets, Rosengren said.    The Main Street Lending Facility, which aims to make credit available to small and medium sized businesses, should launch by the end of the month, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said on Tuesday.  Businesses that meet the requirements will be able to turn to their lenders for a loan, Rosengren said. However, the program will not help all businesses in need, he cautioned.   \u201cIt will not be able to assist everyone, but we expect that it will provide an important bridge for many businesses that employ much of the American workforce,\u201d Rosengren said.   As businesses reopen, many people will be nervous about returning to the workplace and demand for many services will stay low until those concerns are lifted, he said.   \u201cIn sum, simply allowing businesses to reopen is not a panacea,\u201d Rosengren said. \u201cPublic health solutions are paramount \u2013 without them, it will be virtually impossible to return to full employment.\u201d  Reporting by Jonnelle Marte; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama","7":"CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. farmers that grow crops such as corn or soybeans will receive coronavirus assistance payments based on either half of their 2019 production or the supplies they had on hand as of Jan. 15, the government said on Tuesday.

WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus defended the agency\u2019s role after the United States again withheld full support for a resolution on the pandemic.  \u201cWe want accountability more than anyone,\u201d Tedros told a virtual meeting of the WHO\u2019S 194 member states. \u201cWe will continue providing strategic leadership to coordinate the global response.\u201d  Washington allowed the resolution calling for a review into the global response to the pandemic to pass by consensus, but said it objected to language about reproductive health rights and permission for poor countries to waive patent rules.  WHO officials running the meeting clapped and cheered after the resolution was passed without a vote hours after Trump tweeted his threat to pull the United States out of the body.  It calls for a review into the WHO-led global response, something the United States has demanded.  But the U.S. mission in Geneva said in a statement that paragraphs on the right of poor countries to waive patents to obtain medicine during a health emergency would \u201csend the wrong message to innovators\u201d trying to produce new drugs and vaccines.  The reproductive healthcare language could be interpreted as requiring countries to permit abortion. \u201cThe United States believes in legal protections for the unborn,\u201d it said.  China and the United States also sparred in the closing moments of the assembly over the issue of Taiwan. Taiwan lobbied hard to be included as an observer at the two-day meeting and received support from the United States, Japan and others, but says it was not invited due to opposition from China.  Even as Trump has proposed quitting the WHO, the body has received backing and a two-year pledge of $2 billion in funds from China\u2019s President Xi Jinping.  Many other leaders expressed support for Tedros.  European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called for international cooperation in response to the pandemic.  \u201cAt times like these, the greatest act of courage is to play as a team,\u201d she continued, without an overt reference to the United States.  During his three years in office, Trump has criticised many international organisations and quit some. Still, European diplomats said they were taken aback by Washington\u2019s decision to stand aside at the WHO while China is boosting its role.  \u201cIt was so striking to see Xi Jinping seizing the opportunity to open up, with broad (cooperation), and make a proposal for $2 billion, and say if ever there is a vaccine they will share it with everyone,\u201d a European diplomat said.  \u201cIt\u2019s exactly what we feared: the space liberated by Washington will be taken up by China.\u201d  The WHO declined to comment on Trump\u2019s threat to quit, saying only that it had received his letter and was considering its contents.  Tuesday\u2019s resolution calls for a review into how the novel coronavirus spread after making the jump from animals to humans, believed to have happened in the Chinese city of Wuhan last year.

Powell and Mnuchin were testifying to the Senate Banking Committee as Congress considers whether to roll out trillions of dollars of additional aid to bolster an economy that was brought to a virtual standstill by lockdowns imposed in March and April.  The Trump administration has been criticized for initially downplaying the pandemic, which has now killed more than 90,000 Americans, and not ensuring that enough medical supplies were in place to battle the virus.  Essential workers \u201cput their lives on the line for very low wages, and they\u2019re still worried about paying their bills.

When Mnuchin started to thank \u201call the essential workers,\u201d Brown interrupted him. \u201cThanking is great, but is it fair our economy pays the essential workers so little in such work conditions?\u201d   Senators are also expected to have sharp questions about the additional actions needed to keep the world's largest economy afloat, and missteps in rolling out some $3 trillion in aid so far. (See graphic here showing how the money moved.)  The hearing https:\/\/www.banking.senate.gov started at 10 a.m. (1400 GMT) and was expected to last two hours.    As more states reopen businesses, the government is closing in on the end of an eight-week program to funnel money to small businesses to avoid layoffs, prompting calls to extend the $660 billion Paycheck Protection Program. President Donald Trump said on Monday that such an extension \u201cshould be easy.\u201d  Fiscal relief so far has been lopsided, with big banks getting easy access to Fed backstops, but mom-and-pop businesses initially shut out of paycheck lending programs. Meanwhile, some of the country\u2019s lowest-paid workers are doing the most dangerous jobs.  While over 30 million unemployment claims have been processed since March, workers are reporting delays of weeks or months in getting checks, with others saying they are locked out here of claiming benefits.   Mnuchin, in written testimony published on Tuesday, said he sees high unemployment during the second quarter, but that the overall situation is expected to improve as the economy starts to reopen.  \u201cWorking closely with governors, we are beginning to open the economy in a way that minimizes risks to workers and customers,\u201d Mnuchin said. \u201cWe expect economic conditions to improve in the third and fourth quarters.\u201d  Powell, in prepared remarks for the hearing, said the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act passed in March was \u201ccritical\u201d to the U.S. central bank\u2019s ability to expand credit throughout the economy to offset the blow from the coronavirus.  Other programs aimed at helping larger companies and municipal bond issuers through a sharp recession are just getting started.  The U.S. central bank has slashed interest rates to near zero and set up a broad network of programs to ensure financial markets continue to function during the pandemic. It has also established precedent-setting lending facilities for companies and the first-ever corporate bond purchases.  In remarks broadcast on Sunday night, Powell said  unemployment may hit 25% before it begins to fall, with a contraction in gross domestic product of 20% or more. He added that positive \u201cmedical metrics\u201d that can build consumer confidence would be critical.      Senators are also likely to try to elicit the two officials\u2019 views on the $3 trillion aid bill crafted by Democrats in the House of Representatives. It narrowly passed the Democratic-controlled chamber on Friday, but is opposed by Republicans in the Republican-controlled Senate.  Before the hearing on Tuesday, Mnuchin met with Vice President Mike Pence, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy at the U.S. Capitol, according to the White House.   Mnuchin also will face questions by the Senate banking panel over processing glitches that held up small-business loan applications as the Paycheck Protection Program was rushed into service in early April, as well as on abrupt policy changes that required many larger, publicly traded restaurant chains with access to capital markets to return their funds under the threat of audits.  A separate congressional oversight board issued its first report here on the response, consisting largely of questions that could be asked in Tuesday's hearing.

The girls were killed last week in the deeply conservative  and war-torn northwestern area of North Waziristan in what police suspect was an act of \u201chonour killing\u201d.   Police say the video which they believe prompted the girls\u2019 murder was shot a year ago but had only recently been uploaded on social media.    \u201cThe females were sisters, identified as Jasima Bibi and Saeeda Bibi,\u201d North Waziristan police chief Shafiullah Gandapur told Reuters.  Their family had been displaced by a military operation against militants in their hometown, he said.

Police also said the girls\u2019 father and uncle had been arrested on suspicion of concealing the murder and evidence.  The killing is the first high-profile criminal case to be pursued in the formerly autonomous tribal region, where ultra-conservative customs present a big challenge for police.  Pakistan extended police jurisdiction to the area in 2018, ending more than a century of relatively autonomous rule in a region used by Taliban and al Qaeda militants to launch attacks in Pakistan and neighbouring Afghanistan. \u00a0  Police said the girls\u2019 relatives and local residents did not want a case registered because of \u201clocal traditions\u201d, so the police became the complainant in the case.  Thousands of incidents of violence against women perceived to have \u201cdamaged\u201d family honour are reported in Pakistan each year and many more go unreported, rights groups say. Pakistan enacted legislation to protect against \u201chonour killings\u201d in 2016.

In a decision dated May 18 and seen by Reuters, the judge said the April 29 order by market regulator CENACE risked distorting free competition to the detriment of the consumer, and Mexico\u2019s commitments to promote a clean environment.  CENACE suspended the plants, arguing that the intermittency of wind and solar power threatened the reliability of the national power supply during the coronavirus crisis.  However, after several suits were filed to contest that suspension, the judge found that the risks cited by CENACE were less serious than the implications of undermining competition and jeopardizing Mexico\u2019s transition towards clean energy.  On Friday, both Canada and the European Union wrote letters to the government complaining about the CENACE\u2019s move, asking for an audience with Energy Minister Rocio Nahle. Nahle said on Monday she would respond to their concerns this week.  Late on Friday, her ministry published an order that gives the government more scope to control the process of approving new renewable energy projects, further angering those who feel the administration is squeezing out private companies.  President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, a leftist who is intent on giving the state a bigger role in the energy sector, on Monday rejected criticism of the government\u2019s agenda.  He said he wanted to level the playing field in a sector that for too long had been beholden to private interests.  Asked for comment by Reuters, Mexico\u2019s Federal Economic Competition Commission (Cofece) said it was studying the orders issued by CENACE and the energy ministry, and would make a determination on them if it decided to open an investigation.

(Reuters) - When a senior living facility in Amarillo, Texas suspected a nurse may have caught the novel coronavirus this month, it had a list within five minutes of staff and residents the nurse could have infected.   High-tech wristbands worn by The Legacy at Town Square\u2019s 35 workers and 49 residents expedited contact tracing, the otherwise pain-staking process of interviewing patients to determine who crossed paths with them.   The nurse tested negative an hour later and Legacy did not have to isolate or test others. But its experience shows how wristbands and other wearables have emerged as tools to automatically record encounters between people at places that can mandate their use.  Facilities with quick contact tracing following infections in the coming months will be better positioned to ward off outbreaks and stay open, according to epidemiologists.  \u201cIt makes you ready to make the best operational decisions at a moment\u2019s notice,\u201d said Joseph Walter, executive director at LifeWell Senior Living\u2019s Legacy facility.  Australia, Singapore and other governments have sought to enable smartphones to record people\u2019s contacts. But data privacy rules imposed by smartphone software makers Apple Inc and Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google limit the utility of smartphone-based systems, while many employers do not let workers carry phones because of security and safety considerations.  Manufacturers are hawking wearables online priced as low as $4.    The Legacy in Texas uses technology from CarePredict, a startup that added contact tracing functionality to its system for elderly care homes when the pandemic struck.   CarePredict\u2019s Tempo bracelets function as a call button to summon staff, a digital room key, and a health and activity tracker. More than 20 care facilities in the United States have the devices, which cost about $1 per day per user, according to CarePredict.    The wristbands use infrared light to connect to beacons on a wall in each room, creating a record of who has been near whom, where and for how long.   Walter said the system has proved accurate over the last two years for tracking residents\u2019 activities at The Legacy, but its reliability in contact tracing is yet to be seen.    Setting up beacons and special-purpose devices like CarePredict\u2019s Tempo may be too costly and complex for some facilities. But wearables that communicate with each other through Bluetooth signals may be more suitable, and software development company Myplanet and automaker Ford Motor Co are among those testing popular Bluetooth-based fitness trackers and smartwatches from companies such as Fitbit Inc and Samsung Electronics Co.   One of Myplanet\u2019s experiments found that companies hoping to reduce costs and hassles by allowing workers to use existing gadgets will face connection challenges because of variances in the devices\u2019 Bluetooth technology, said Greg Fields, who is leading the Toronto-based firm\u2019s contact tracing efforts for its multinational clients.  Apple and Google soon plan to release contact tracing technology to smooth out some of the connection issues on phones, and device makers are confident that the tech giants will do the same for wearables, said David Su, CEO at Atmosic, a Silicon Valley-based wireless chip company.   The companies did not respond to requests for comment on the speculation. While Apple-Google technology would improve reliability in contact tracing, devices that use it would need access to the internet and a government-authorized contact tracing app.  Ford conducted a small test of pricey smartwatches that alert wearers when they are standing closer than guidelines allow, but they too require Wi-Fi, which is sometimes unavailable in sprawling plants, Ford manufacturing chief Gary Johnson told Reuters.   The automaker also is testing chips on identification badges, he said, and those could track sustained encounters or issue reminders to keep distance.

On Monday, Sao Paulo Governor Joao Doria and Mayor Bruno Covas said they were working to turn Wednesday, Thursday and Monday into holidays, with Friday a day off at the discretion of employers.  The holidays they are moving are: the Roman Catholic feast of Corpus Christi, normally on June 11; Consci\u00eancia Negra, a Black Awarenss holiday normally celebrated on Nov. 20, and  Constitutional Revolution Day, normally celebrated July 9.  Eleven financial industry associations, including Brazilian banking lobby Febraban, also wrote to Doria expressing concern about advancing the holidays, according to a copy of the document seen by Reuters.   The governor\u2019s office said it had not received the letter. Febraban and the mayor\u2019s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  On Monday, Doria and Covas said they were taking the emergency measure to increase social isolation, pointing to data that showed more people stayed at home on recent weekends and holidays.  Brazil\u2019s coronavirus outbreak has exploded in recent weeks, with more than 250,000 confirmed cases, third-highest in the world, and nearly 17,000 fatalities. The city and state of Sao Paulo are at the epicenter, with about a quarter of the country\u2019s deaths and diagnoses.  The associations expressed concerns said the holidays may cause issues such as closing bank branches that are working to pay out emergency stipends to nearly 50 million people during the pandemic.       They requested an exemption from the holidays to continue with regularly scheduled operations.

In a sometimes testy hearing before the Senate Banking Committee, Mnuchin and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the nearly $3 trillion in coronavirus rescue programs rolled out by the federal government over the past two months were working to support an economy devastated by the novel coronavirus.  But the Treasury and Fed chiefs faced tough questions over whether the administration\u2019s plans to quickly reopen the economy in the wake of lockdowns imposed in March and April would leave low-wage workers without adequate protections from the virus.  Congress is considering legislation that would free up trillions of dollars of additional aid to further bolster the economy, help states and increase pay for essential workers who are doing some of the most dangerous jobs.  President Donald Trump has been criticized for initially downplaying the pandemic, which has now killed more than 90,000 Americans, and not ensuring that enough medical supplies were in place to battle the virus.  \u201cHow many workers should give their lives to increase the GDP or the Dow Jones by 1,000 points?\u201d asked Senator Sherrod Brown, the committee\u2019s top Democrat.  \u201cNo workers should give their lives to do that, senator, and I think your characterization is unfair. We have provided enormous amounts of equipment,\u201d Mnuchin replied.  Mnuchin said he wanted to thank \u201call the essential workers,\u201d but Brown interrupted him, adding, \u201cThanking is great, but is it fair our economy pays the essential workers so little in such work conditions?\u201d  Powell said new Treasury-backed Fed lending programs aimed at mid-size companies and municipal bond markets would be up and running by the beginning of June. Only a \u201cfairly modest\u201d amount of money has gone out through the Fed credit programs so far.  The U.S. central bank has slashed interest rates to near zero and set up a broad network of programs to ensure financial markets continue to function during the pandemic. It has also established precedent-setting lending facilities for companies and the first-ever corporate bond purchases.  Initial recipients of the $660 billion Paycheck Protection Program, which provides forgivable loans to small businesses, are nearing the end of their 8-week loan terms, and calls by senators for extensions increased during Tuesday\u2019s hearing.  Mnuchin said he hoped to reach a bipartisan agreement  \u201ctechnical fix\u201d that would extend the loans.  \u201cCompanies are really having issues with not necessarily being able to use it within those 8 weeks. They don\u2019t want more money, they want flexibility that they can use it in longer than an 8-week period,\u201d Mnuchin said.  Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat, also pressed Mnuchin on why participants in the \u201chalf-a-trillion-dollar slush fund\u201d supporting the \u201cMain Street\u201d lending program and Fed credit facilities aimed at larger borrowers have no specific requirements to retain employees.  Mnuchin said such terms were \u201cdiscussed with people on both sides of the aisle\u201d as the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act was being negotiated in March.  (See graphic here showing CARES Act money flows.)  Mnuchin also said that Treasury\u2019s base-case analysis showed at least some capital losses on the Fed loan programs were expected, but that there could be instances where the Treasury earned a return on its capital. Under the most optimistic scenario, markets would fully recover and the Fed facilities would not be needed, he added.  While more than 30 million unemployment claims have been processed since March, workers are reporting delays of weeks or months in getting checks, with others saying they are locked out here of claiming benefits.   Mnuchin also said he sees more job losses in the next month before the economy starts to improve.  \u201cWorking closely with governors, we are beginning to open the economy in a way that minimizes risks to workers and customers,\u201d Mnuchin said. \u201cWe expect economic conditions to improve in the third and fourth quarters.\u201d  Although the hearing was held by videoconference, Mnuchin met with Vice President Mike Pence, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy at the U.S. Capitol, according to the White House.

Thabane\u2019s departure marks the end of one of Lesotho\u2019s longest political careers, one marked by exile, intrigue, tensions with the military and a political crisis that deepened when police named him as a murder suspect in February.  \u201cThe time to retire from the great theatre of action, take leave from public life and office has finally arrived,\u201d the 80-year-old Thabane told citizens in a speech on Lesotho TV.   His own All Basotho Convention (ABC) party, opposition figures and South African mediators had all been pressing Thabane to resign over the murder case.  Gunmen shot dead his previous wife, Lipolelo, on June 14, 2017, two days before he took office.  Maesaiah has been formally charged with the murder. Though named as a suspect, Thabane has not been charged. They both deny any involvement.  Lawmakers have said Thabane was not offered immunity from prosecution in return for stepping down, and it remains unclear whether he will now face any charges.  Finance Minister Moeketsi Majoro, named by parliament as Thabane\u2019s replacement, is expected to be sworn in on Wednesday.  \u201cI plead with the entire nation... to give my successor utmost support, and for my part I wish to assure him of my support,\u201d Thabane said in his televised address.  Thabane\u2019s coalition fell apart last week, leaving him with no legal choice but to resign.  \u201cIt is a relief and we believe... Lesotho will be steered to greatness and good governance as well as peace,\u201d said Motlalentoa Letsosa, deputy leader of the Democratic Congress party, the main opposition party which will now join a new coalition government under Majoro.  Lesotho, a small kingdom encircled by a South African mountain range, has seen several coups since gaining independence from Britain in 1966.

The authorities\u2019 task to save lives was complicated by ongoing efforts to curb the coronavirus pandemic and enforce social distancing to avoid a surge of infections. Many thousands of migrant workers are on the roads trying to get home from big cities after a nationwide lockdown destroyed their livelihoods.  Approaching from the Bay of Bengal, super cyclone Amphan was expected to hit the coast of eastern India and southern Bangladesh with winds gusting up to 185 kmh (115 mph) - the equivalent of a category 5 hurricane.  The Indian weather department forecast a storm surge of 10- to 16-foot waves - as high as a two-storey house - that could swamp mud dwellings along the coast, uproot communication towers and inundate roads and rail tracks.   There will be extensive damage to standing crops and plantations in the states of West Bengal and Odisha while large boats and ships could get torn from their moorings, the weather service said in a bulletin late on Tuesday.  Authorities were hastily repurposing quarantine facilities for the looming cyclone soon after easing the world\u2019s biggest lockdown against the virus, which in India is reported to have infected more than 100,000 people and killed 3,163.  Railway officials diverted away from the cyclone\u2019s path a number of trains carrying thousands of migrant workers to eastern states from the capital New Delhi where they had lost their jobs due to coronavirus lockdowns.  \u201cWe have just about six hours left to evacuate people from their homes and we also have to maintain social distancing norms,\u201d disaster management official S.G. Rai told Reuters.  \u201cThe cyclone could wash away thousands of huts and standing crops.\u201d   About 300,000 people had been moved to storm shelters, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee said. The state capital Kolkata lies near the cyclone\u2019s path and there was concern about people living in about 1,500 old, dilapidated buildings.  Neighbouring Bangladesh, where the cyclone posed a devastating threat along a low-lying, marshy coast, was shifting hundreds of thousands of people to higher ground. Bangladeshi authorities were also urging use of masks against the virus, which has caused 20,995 infections and 314 deaths.  \u201cWe have taken necessary steps so that people can maintain distance and wear masks,\u201d said Enamur Rahman, the junior minister for disaster management. He said 12,000 cyclone shelters were set up to accommodate more than 5 million people.   Bangladeshi officials said the cyclone could set off tidal waves and heavy rainfall, unleashing floods.  It was expected to hit land between the districts of Chittagong and Khulna, just 150 km (93 miles) from refugee camps housing more than a million Rohingya in flimsy shelters.  Aid workers have stockpiled emergency items such as food, tarpaulins and water purification tablets.   \u201cWe are really very worried,\u201d said Haiko Magtrayo, a worker of the International Committee of the Red Cross based in the nearby town of Cox\u2019s Bazar.   Hundreds more Rohingya, rescued from boats adrift in the Bay of Bengal, are living on the flood-prone island of Bhasan Char.

Carissa Etienne, the head of the WHO-affiliated Pan American Health Organization, said U.S. contributions account for about 60% of the regional health agency\u2019s budget. She also pointed to successful past collaborations with the U.S. government to combat diseases like malaria and yellow fever.  However, in recent days Trump has ramped up his criticism of the WHO\u2019s response to the coronavirus pandemic, threatening to reconsider his government\u2019s membership of the global body and to permanently end its funding.  \u201cAs the curve of the pandemic flattens or falls in other parts of the world, the virus is surging across our region,\u201d Etienne told a virtual briefing on COVID-19 in the Americas.       \u201cPAHO hopes that we will continue collaboration with the United States and all of our allies.\u201d  She said COVID-19 cases reached more than 2 million across the Americas as of Monday, with deaths standing at 121,000: \u201cThis represents a staggering increase of 14% for cases and for deaths from just last week,\u201d Etienne said.  PAHO officials voiced concern the new coronavirus was spreading rapidly in the tri-border area of the Amazon between Colombia, Peru and Brazil, which currently has the worst outbreak of any developing nation. The regional outbreak threatens to infect remote indigenous communities in the rainforest.  Etienne added there were about 20,000 confirmed coronavirus cases in Amazon provinces, and isolated villages there have minimal access to healthcare.  PAHO officials urged that special measures be taken to protect vulnerable populations among the indigenous, poor and racial minorities.   They said the contagion was moving fast in densely populated Amazon border cities such as Manaus, Leticia and Iquitos, and the greatest danger was that COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, risked spreading to indigenous villages in the forest where inhabitants had no protection.

The Federal Trade Commission said on Tuesday First Data, one of the world\u2019s largest payment processors, will pay $40 million, while Chi \u201cVincent\u201d Ko will pay $270,374, with the sums used to provide refunds to consumers.  First Data also agreed to improve its screening of \u201chigh-risk\u201d merchant clients, and hire a monitor for three years.  Neither defendant admitted or denied wrongdoing. The settlements require approval by a Manhattan federal judge.

First Data \u201crepeatedly looked the other way\u201d from 2012 to 2014 as First Pay Solutions LLC, which Ko founded, opened hundreds of accounts for merchants engaged in fraud, the FTC said.  Ko would open accounts under false names, let merchants process payments through hundreds of shell companies, and provide Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) with deceptive information to open the accounts, it said.  Three scams were subjects of prior FTC enforcement actions, and the fourth was a subject of a federal criminal prosecution, the agency said.  First Data bought First Pay\u2019s merchant accounts and hired most of its staff in May 2015, and hired Ko as vice president of strategic partnerships in January 2017. He is no longer employed there. Wells Fargo was not accused of wrongdoing.  Fiserv said the settlement was in the best interest of First Data, its clients and their customers.  Jim Walden, a lawyer for Ko, said his client denied knowing First Pay had allowed a small number of \u201crogue independent agents\u201d to sign up dishonest merchants.

Without one, it\u2019s unlikely economic activity can resume fully.  So the race is on, and the rewards are rich: AstraZeneca (AZN.L) has vaulted into the position of the most valuable British company after receiving a U.S. pledge for up to $1.2 billion for its experimental vaccine.  Pharma\/biotech shares have outperformed broader equities since Feb 19. Investors twitchy for vaccine news sent the share price of biotech company Moderna 20% higher when it said its vaccine trials showed promise. Rivals Novavax and Inovio also rose when they secured vaccine development funding.  The United States has vaccine development deals with Johnson & Johnson and Sanofi, too. But many others, big and small, are in the race: Imperial College, Gilead Sciences, Roche, China\u2019s CanSino Biologics and India\u2019s Glenmark to name just a few.  (GRAPHIC: Healthcare outperforms - here)  European clashes over how to handle the economic impact of the COVID-19 crisis raised fears for the bloc\u2019s future, but a Franco-German proposal aimed at helping the worst-hit states represents a pivotal moment. The markets want to the see the details, however. All eyes will be on the European Commission, which on Wednesday presents its pandemic recovery plan.   The task is to ensure weaker states such as Italy can access funding without adding to their debt burden. But EU states remain divided over whether recovery funds should be funnelled through loans or transfers. If those opposed to big spending manage to water down the plan, the euro and southern European bonds will take a knock.  The change in Germany\u2019s previously hardline stance was momentous. Now it\u2019s the turn of others such as Austria and the Netherlands to decide whether they are ready to cross the Rubicon.

Its latest proposal for a tougher national security regime for the city will almost certainly lead to further violent confrontations on the streets and open a new venue for Sino-U.S. tension.  Only this time it may be worse, which is why the Hang Seng index was hit harder on Friday than even the worst days in the March selldown. China has replaced the leadership in its Hong Kong Liaison office and, foreign envoys reckon, quietly doubled the number of staff there.  The United States has already warned of a tough response.

Smoke billowed from the scene where the Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) flight came down, some roofs had caved in, and debris lay scattered in streets as ambulances rushed through chaotic crowds.  At least one passenger on fight PK 8303, a banker, survived and spoke to officials in hospital, provincial government spokesman Abdur Rashid Channa said.   \u201cThank you so much. God has been merciful,\u201d the passenger said, according to the government statement.  Seemin Jamali, executive director at the nearby Jinnah Hospital, said 17 dead bodies and six wounded people had been brought in. There were no estimates of casualties on the ground in the area where the plane crashed.  \u201cThe aeroplane first hit a mobile tower and crashed over houses,\u201d witness Shakeel Ahmed said near the site, a few kilometres short of the airport.  The Airbus A320 was flying from the eastern city of Lahore to Karachi in the south just as Pakistan was resuming domestic flights in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, according to the aircraft tracking website FlightRadar24.  The pilot told air traffic controllers the plane had lost engine power, according to liveatc.net, which has released aircraft recordings in the past.  \u201cWe are returning back, sir, we have lost engines,\u201d a man was heard saying in a recording released by the website.

Army and rescue services rushed to the area, which appeared to be densely populated.

Opposition to Israel is a core belief for Shi\u2019ite-led Iran, which backs Palestinian and Lebanese armed groups opposed to peace with the Jewish state, which Tehran refuses to recognize.  \u201cThe Zionist regime (Israel) is a deadly, cancerous tumor in the region. It will undoubtedly be uprooted and destroyed,\u201d Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said in an online speech.    The United States and European Union rejected the comments.  U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Twitter dismissed them as \u201cdisgusting and hateful anti-Semitic remarks\u201d that did not represent the tradition of tolerance of ordinary Iranians.  EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said they were \u201ctotally unacceptable and represent a deep source of concern\u201d.  Although leaders of Palestinian militant groups in Gaza, including Hamas and Islamic Jihad, have frequently praised Iran\u2019s financial and military support, Khamenei had not himself previously given public confirmation of Tehran\u2019s weapons supply.  \u201cIran realised Palestinian fighters\u2019 only problem was lack of access to weapons. With divine guidance and assistance, we planned, and the balance of power has been transformed in Palestine, and today the Gaza Strip can stand against the aggression of the Zionist enemy and defeat it,\u201d he said.  Israeli Defence Minister and Alternate Prime Minister Benny Gantz said: \u201cThe State of Israel has great challenges in a variety of arenas. Khamenei\u2019s statement that Israel is a \u2018cancerous tumor\u2019 illustrates this more than anything.\u201d  He said on Facebook: \u201cI do not suggest anyone to test us ...We will be prepared for all threats, and by any means.\u201d  Zeyad al-Nakhala, chief of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, which has publicly admitted getting Iranian arms and funds, praised Khamenei\u2019s comments. \u201cWe are ready for a long jihad and victory is granted,\u201d he said in remarks distributed by the group.   Iranian officials have repeatedly called for an end to Israel, including by a referendum that would exclude most of its Jews while including Palestinians in the region and abroad.  Khamenei suggested global attention on the coronavirus crisis had helped obscure wrongs done to Palestinians. \u201cThe long-lasting virus of Zionists will be eliminated,\u201d he added.   Khamenei was speaking on Iran\u2019s annual Quds Day, which uses the Arabic name for Jerusalem, held on the last Friday of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan.   Iran cancelled nationwide Quds Day rallies due to coronavirus. Iran is one of the most-affected countries in the region with 7,300 deaths and a total of 131,652 infections.  Khamenei also denounced what he called treason by \u201cpolitical and cultural mercenaries in Muslim countries\u201d helping Zionists to downplay the Palestine issue, an apparent reference to some Arab states including Iran\u2019s regional rival Saudi Arabia.

Spain started phasing out one of Europe\u2019s toughest lockdowns earlier this month, but full restrictions had remained in both Madrid and Barcelona because their outbreaks were so severe.

French-born Belgian miller Adrienne Delacroix, whose mill in the Ardennes region of Belgium near Luxembourg has been producing flour for six centuries, said she had to rely on a network of small shops and online sales to supply eager consumers stuck at home and rediscovering baking.  \u201cWe\u2019ve witnessed an explosion in demand from individuals wanting flour,\u201d Delacroix told Reuters from her mill, whose two large water wheels are powered by a tributary of the river Strange, and grind the wheat grain.  With friends and family baking - and sharing their creations via social media - during the coronavirus pandemic, Belgians have been mixing, kneading and proving to overcome boredom.  Delacroix, whose family bought the mill in 1991, believes it could become a habit, even as Belgium has been slowly opening up since May 4. Delacroix, who helped modernise the mill, gave up being a magistrate in 2009 to follow her passion for baking.  \u201cI think it\u2019s been long enough (to have an impact),\u201d she said of the lockdown. \u201cI think the crisis has also brought home the importance of eating local produce,\u201d she said.

He had plenty left over, and donated some of it to Helena, Texas, an 1800s ghost town that draws hundreds to historic buildings and gunfight re-enactments.  The worst oil bust in decades has slashed the bounty that flowed to millions of rural Americans like Ruckman, who said his royalty checks have plummeted 70% since January.  \u201cI imagine they\u2019re going to be dropping quite a bit more,\u201d said Ruckman, who owns the land with his brothers.  The bust has erased tens of thousands of jobs in the drilling and service sectors, dried up local tax revenues and charitable largess that flowed along with crude oil to Texas, North Dakota and Oklahoma.    Thanks to modern drilling technology, shale has turned the United States into the world\u2019s No. 1 energy producer, pumping as much as 13 million barrels per day (bpd) before prices crashed. It added about a percentage point to U.S. GDP between 2010 and 2015. Shale-related jobs lifted the employment rate in Texas and North Dakota to a multiple of the national average.   In DeWitt County, Texas, 80 miles (129 km) southeast of San Antonio, incomes shot up to sixth highest among the state\u2019s 254 counties at the peak of the shale boom in 2014 from 116th a decade ago, based on U.S. tax data.  Shale oil fed a global glut. OPEC and allied producers supported prices by cutting output, but this year Saudi Arabia and Russia briefly pumped more. Then fuel demand collapsed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Oil prices are about half January\u2019s level, and many shale producers have shut wells.   U.S. output could fall about 2 million bpd this year and next, Bank of America has estimated.   (For a graphic on how shale lifted U.S. incomes, click here: tmsnrt.rs\/3g75QvW)  Ruckman is among 12 million U.S. mineral owners who collect \u201cmailbox money,\u201d or payments for oil and gas extracted from their land. He declined to say how much his property drew, but residents in the heart of Texas\u2019 Eagle Ford shale got bigger royalties than many, able to negotiate richer leases because the region came later to the boom.   Royalties, which can range from 12.5% to 25% of the value of oil and gas pumped, helped revitalize DeWitt and other communities in oil patches across the United States.  John Baen, a Texas college professor who owns mineral rights in South Texas, collected as much as $100,000 a month in recent years. The payments have dwindled to $6,000 and by August, he said, \u201cI\u2019ll be lucky to get anything.\u201d     The average oil-land owner collects about $500 a month, according to the National Association of Royalty Owners, but that will not last. April\u2019s price crash was so sharp, falling at one point into negative territory, that minerals holder Jubilee Royalty Holdings received a $1 check that month from Exxon Mobil (XOM.N).  The shale boom paid off debt from restoring DeWitt\u2019s pink granite and sandstone courthouse and expanding the jail. Oil helped finance the area\u2019s Boys and Girls Club, which provides activities for area children.  It brought jobs that cut DeWitt\u2019s unemployment rate to 2.6% in February from 8% a decade earlier. During that time, oil and gas jobs here roughly doubled, according to the Texas Independent Producers & Royalty Owners Association.  (For a graphic on employment in shale regions, click here: tmsnrt.rs\/3g9ppn1)  The boom enabled bookkeeper Karen Jensen Zielonka to find work managing a new restaurant in 2015 and later gave her accounting work for Cuero Oilfield Lodging, a nearby \u201cman camp\u201d for transient workers.   \u201cWhen this first happened they said it would last 25 years,\u201d said Zielonka.     But unemployment rose to 3.5% in March. Cuero Oilfield Lodging camp has been vacant since late March when shale jobs dried up, said manager Tammi Marks, who cut most of her staff.  \u201cWe\u2019re doing a lot of praying,\u201d she said.  Officials here and in other U.S. shale patches are bracing for more cuts. The value of DeWitt\u2019s mineral properties could fall this year by half, from $5.3 billion last year, county chief executive Daryl Fowler estimated.  Officials do not expect to reduce county jobs, \u201cbut it can happen,\u201d said Fowler.   In the last oil bust, from 2015-2016, DeWitt\u2019s average incomes fell 31%. That drop was short-lived, with pay rising again by 2018.   Oilfield worker Freddie Fuentes sailed through that period, without losing his job. He fears this one will sting much more.  \u201cRight now we have about five weeks of work,\u201d said Fuentes. \u201cAfter that we\u2019re done.\u201d    Some drillers hope for a turnaround. Oil prices have bounced from the April bottom when U.S. crude ended one day in negative territory. Prices now are about half January\u2019s level.   Lonestar Resources is putting oil in storage tanks that typically hold brackish water, said Chief Executive Frank Bracken, counting on a price rebound.  Still, Bracken said, \u201croyalty owners are going to see vastly diminished paychecks.\u201d    This year\u2019s crash might be much worse than recent downturns, said Amanda Weinstein, assistant professor of economics at the University of Akron, who has studied shale booms. Young people who lose jobs may \u201cfeel like there\u2019s not as much for them in that town anymore,\u201d and leave.   Williston, North Dakota, center of the Bakken shale field, was so devastated by the 1980s bust that it lagged the nation in economic growth until shale started there around 2006, Weinstein said.   At the Helena ghost town, oil royalties donated by Ruckman and others fixed a historic home whose porch had been propped up with a salvaged telephone pole. The historical society had hoped to spruce up the attraction with a visitor\u2019s pavilion and new restrooms, said Trip Ruckman, Paul Ruckman\u2019s cousin.  \u201cSome plans are on hold given the situation,\u201d he said.

The new certificates set criteria for health and hygiene in airlines, airports and other transport, as well as hotels, restaurants, bars and cafes. They will be awarded by international institutions and information will be sent to tour operators and will be accessible to tourists.  At Istanbul\u2019s Four Seasons hotel, general manager Tarek Mourad said the scheme would help reassure visitors, adding that Turkey\u2019s robust healthcare infrastructure, major new airport and far-reaching flag carrier Turkish Airlines were also assets.  \u201cIf you put all these together we create a better chance for Turkey to recover faster,\u201d Mourad said on a terrace overlooking Hagia Sophia, once Christendom\u2019s foremost cathedral and then a mosque before becoming a leading tourist attraction as a museum.  Travel company TUI said it had offers for travel from June 15. Leisure airline Corendon hopes to launch a summer package in late June, whereby Dutch holidaymakers will be tested for the virus before flying and will remain restricted to hotel grounds.  Ersoy said COVID-19 testing centres were being set up at airports.  \u201cThose guests who come without having been tested in the last 72 hours will all be tested,\u201d he said.  Passengers in terminals will be required to wear masks, and temperatures will be taken with forehead thermometers.   The project has drawn support from the tourism sector but there are worries about the level of international interest.   \u201cWe have to be realistic, this will be a slow process. The opening of 50% (of hotels) in July would be a big success in my opinion,\u201d said Erkan Yagci, chairman of the Mediterranean Touristic Hoteliers and Investors Association.   Turkish Travel Agents Association Chairman Firuz Baglikaya said the main foreign arrivals would not be until September-October, and Russia, the leading market, which sent seven million tourists last year, would start later than others.  Foreign currency earnings from tourism may fall 60-70% this year, with the domestic market halving in size, he said.  The initial test from the end of this month will be the resumption of domestic tourism, but the real prize in terms of visitor numbers and revenues is foreign tourists.  In the Mediterranean tourism hub of Antalya, domestic tourists made up less than 20% of some 100 million annual overnight stays, according to the owner of a holiday complex in the region who declined to be named.  \u201cThe rest is ... foreign visitors. Without them, there is no point in opening,\u201d he said.

Communist Party rulers in Beijing unveiled details on Friday, a day after proposing the legislation that critics see as a turning point for China\u2019s most free-wheeling city.  Pro-democracy activists and politicians in the former British colony have for years opposed such legislation, arguing it could erode its autonomy, guaranteed under the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d agreement under which Britain returned Hong Kong to China in 1997.  \u201cBeijing is attempting to silence Hong Kongers\u2019 critical voices with force and fear,\u201d activist Joshua Wong, one of the leaders of pro-democracy street protests in 2014, tweeted.  Some pro-democracy lawmakers denounced the plans as \u201cthe end of Hong Kong\u201d.  Hong Kong activists called for people to rise up against the proposal, aimed at tackling secession, subversion, terrorism, and foreign interference, that has sent shockwaves across the business and diplomatic communities.  Foreign diplomats fear establishing new Beijing agencies in Hong Kong could give mainland security and intelligence officers enforcement powers that could potentially put rights and freedoms, protected in the handover agreement, at risk.  Calls have emerged for flash mobs at night across the territory and democracy activists plan to meet the press to announce \u201cstreet action\u201d.  \u201cThis is a great moment to reboot the protest,\u201d said university student Kay, 24, who took part in last year\u2019s often violent anti-government and anti-Beijing protests that entered a lull this year due to the coronavirus.  The security law plan hit financial markets on concerns the city\u2019s status as a financial hub is at risk. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng index closed down 5.6%, its largest daily percentage drop since July 2015.  Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said her government will \u201cfully cooperate\u201d with the Chinese parliament to safeguard national security, which she said would not affect rights, freedoms or judicial independence.  The proposals could heighten tensions between Beijing and Washington, whose relationship is already frayed by trade disputes and reciprocal accusations over handling of the pandemic.  U.S. President Donald Trump warned Washington would react \u201cvery strongly\u201d if Beijing went ahead with the security law.  Pompeo said the \u201cdisastrous proposal\u201d would be the \u201cdeath knell\u201d for Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy and that the United States stood with the people of Hong Kong.  \u201cIt is starting to look like a U.S.-China summer of discontent in the making,\u201d said Stephen Innes, chief global market strategist at AxiCorp.  Innes said the new law could reignite the 2019 anti-China protests, the biggest crisis the city has faced since 1997.  In his annual report to parliament, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said China would establish a \u201csound\u201d legal system and enforcement mechanisms to ensure national security in Hong Kong and Macau, a former Portuguese colony that returned to China in 1999.  The proposed move will see China\u2019s parliament endorse, then annex the laws into Hong Kong\u2019s mini-constitution, the Basic Law, without any local legislative scrutiny, according to a draft seen by Reuters.  The document said the laws will safeguard the central government\u2019s \u201coverall jurisdiction\u201d as well as Hong Kong\u2019s \u201chigh autonomy\u201d given Hong Kong\u2019s \u201cincreasingly notable national security risks\u201d.  \u201cWhen needed, relevant national security organs of the Central People\u2019s Government will set up agencies\u201d in Hong Kong to safeguard national security, the draft said.  Foreign diplomats fear this could formalise and expand the presence of mainland security and intelligence services in Hong Kong. Currently they can take no enforcement action in the city.  Hong Kong\u2019s judiciary, along with the government and legislature, must \u201ceffectively prevent, stop and punish acts endangering national security\u201d, it states. The reference to Hong Kong\u2019s staunchly independent legal system has rattled some Hong Kong lawyers.   A previous attempt to adopt similar legislation in 2003 was met with a protest that drew around half a million people on to the streets and was eventually shelved.  \u201cIt is essentially declaring directly that \u2018one country, two systems\u2019 is null and a failure,\u201d said Eric Cheung, principal lecturer at Hong Kong University\u2019s department of law, of the legislation.  Beijing said the legislation would strengthen the \u201ctwo systems\u201d formula and was in Hong Kong\u2019s interest. Lam said Beijing\u2019s intention was to tackle illegal activities that had damaged national security.  Beijing\u2019s move is expected to lead to the flight of capital and talent, bankers and headhunters said.  \u201cIn some cases where clients had a bit of inertia and hoped things that happened last year will just go away, they will now step on the gas to reduce their wealth concentration risk here,\u201d said a senior banker at a European private bank.  The U.S. State Department warned a high degree of autonomy and respect for human rights were key to preserving the territory\u2019s special status in U.S. law, which has helped it maintain its position as a world financial centre.

The drop, which Statscan called the largest on record, was led by a collapse in car sales and matched the 10% decline forecast by analysts in a Reuters poll. In volume terms, sales plummeted a record 8.2%.  \u201cData for March show an ugly situation even before the economy was tamped down for a full month,\u201d said Royce Mendes, a senior economist with CIBC Capital Markets in a note.

Statscan revised February\u2019s gain up slightly to 0.4% from an initial 0.3% and, in a preliminary flash estimate, said retail sales in April could fall 15.6%.  About 40% of retailers closed their stores in March as officials urged people to stay at home, Statscan said, adding the pandemic forced many businesses to open or expand their e-commerce platforms in March. On a year-over-year basis, retail e-commerce jumped 40.4%.   Auto and parts dealership sales dropped 35.6% on lower demand, while gasoline station sales fell 19.8%, the largest decline on record, on both lower demand and lower prices as the result of a global supply glut.

Russia\u2019s overall case tally, the world\u2019s second highest after the United States, rose by 8,894 to 326,448, while Friday\u2019s tally of 150 new deaths pushed the toll to 3,249.  Moscow\u2019s Mayor Sergei Sobyanin has said he expects the toll to prove much higher in May than in April. It is still much lower than many European countries with fewer cases, something that has sparked debate, but which Russia defends.    Speaking at a televised government meeting by video link, Putin said there had been a gradual decrease in the number of new infections reported daily in recent days and that the situation \u201cas a whole is stabilising\u201d.  \u201cAt the same time it is very important this decline happens against the backdrop of a constant and significant rise in the number of tests,\u201d he said.  Russia\u2019s national virus data shows a steady decline in the number of reported cases, but the Kremlin\u2019s critics and Russian media outlets have questioned the veracity of some of the figures.   A poll of 509 doctors on an app called the \u201cDoctor\u2019s Handbook\u201d cited by the Meduza news website on Thursday found that more than a third of those surveyed had been ordered to attribute pneumonia deaths caused by COVID-19 to other causes.   The health ministry did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on the report.    The survey found almost 40% of medical professionals said they had inadequate supplies of personal protective equipment, while 23.4% said their hospitals were not ready to admit patients with suspected coronavirus infections.

The Czech Republic took early action in March to close borders, schools and much of the services sector and has also been eager to relax many of the restrictions.  Most retail and sports grounds have already reopened and from Monday public events for up to 300 people will be allowed and swimming pools and schools will reopen.       Health Minister Adam Vojtech said an initial easing of restrictions from May 11 had not had an adverse effect.  \u201cThere are no negative trends noted, it is still valid that the Czech Republic has managed the situation very well,\u201d he told reporters, adding that the relaxation of lockdown would continue.   The Czech Republic had recorded 8,757 cases of COVID-19 by Friday morning, with 306 deaths.  There were currently two main local infection hot spots, chief public health officer Jarmila Razova said - Prague, and a mine in the east of the country, where more than 100 cases have been identified, mostly among the miners from one shaft and their families.  A rise in cases to a May high of 111 on Tuesday, were mainly attributed to the mine.

Cyclone Amphan killed at least 96 people, officials said after it swept in from the Bay of Bengal on Wednesday. Eighty fatalities were in the eastern Indian state of West Bengal and 16 were in neighbouring Bangladesh, after winds of up to 185 km per hour (115 mph) caused flooding, blew away roofs, uprooted trees and ripped up power lines.   \u201cThe federal and state government tried everything we could to minimise the damage from the cyclone. Still, we weren\u2019t able to save the lives of around 80 people,\u201d Prime Minister Modi told reporters on Friday at a school in the West Bengal town of Basirhat during a stop on a tour to inspect the damage.  He said India stood with the people of the affected region and announced emergency aid of 10 billion rupees ($132 million) to help West Bengal state, which is also dealing with the coronavirus epidemic.  Modi was flown over the area, surveying vast tracts of land under water, while in Kolkata, capital of West Bengal, police used drones to assess the damage from Amphan, which killed at least 19 people in the city.  The total death toll is expected to rise as communications are restored and authorities reach villages cut off by blocked roads, particularly in India\u2019s low-lying Sundarbans delta, home to 4 million people and thick mangrove forests that are a critical tiger habitat.  In the Sundarbans\u2019 Gosaba, an administrative area of the river delta that juts into the sea, the storm completely destroyed around 26,000 homes and damaged another 14,000, local disaster management official Pradip Kumar Dalui said.  The cyclone also damaged some 19 kilometres of embankments around Gosaba, causing 13 breaches that led salty water to inundate swathes of land, he said.  \u201cThe most urgent problem is the embankments. If they aren\u2019t fixed, we won\u2019t be able to save the Sundarbans,\u201d Dalui told Reuters by phone.  Sankar Halder, who runs a non-profit organisation that supports issues such as health and education in the Sundarbans, said that without temporary shelters thousands of homeless would be completely exposed to monsoon rains that will arrive in a few weeks.  The crisis could be compounded by the ongoing coronavirus outbreak as many returning migrant workers had been quarantined at home but are now forced to mix with the rest of the population, he said.  \u201cWe don\u2019t know the scale of the disaster that awaits us,\u201d Halder said.  Modi, along with West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee and other officials, surveyed parts of the state from an air force helicopter, looking down on acre upon acre of land swamped with flood waters, according to footage from Reuters partner ANI.  \u201cDespite this, West Bengal is fighting well. We are all with West Bengal in these adverse times,\u201d Modi told reporters at the school in Basirhat.    In Kolkata, an estimated 10,000 trees were brought down during the storm that lasted several hours and brought extensive flooding, officials said.  \u201cThe city is still in a state of shock,\u201d said Kolkata\u2019s deputy mayor Atin Ghosh, adding that municipal teams, civil defence personnel, police personnel have been working overtime to restore road connectivity.   \u201cBut there is an acute shortage of manpower due to coronavirus-related restrictions,\u201d Ghosh said, referring to a nationwide lockdown to curb the spread of the virus.  Initial estimates from the Bangladesh government put the damage to infrastructure, housing, fisheries and livestock, water resources and agriculture at about 11 billion taka ($130 million).  \u201cSome 1,100 km of road, 200 bridges and 150 km of dams in coastal districts have been damaged,\u201d said Enamur Rahman, junior minister for disaster management and relief.  Crops have been damaged over an area of 176,000 hectares, Agriculture Minister Abdur Razzaque said, while the electricity authority was scrambling to restore power to some 10 million people.  \u201cIt has left a trail of destruction,\u201d said Rahman.

Revenue at its cloud computing business rose about 58%.   Alibaba CFO Maggie Wu said the results contrasted with the company\u2019s guidance from the previous quarter, when it had predicted a drop in revenue.  \u201cI\u2019m pleased to report we reported better than expected March quarter results,\u201d she said.  With China\u2019s economy starting up again much ahead of major economies in Europe and the United States, the e-commerce group said it expected to generate more than 650 billion yuan in revenue in fiscal 2021.

Deere\u2019s fresh forecast comes more than a month after President Donald Trump announced a $19 billion relief program to help U.S. farmers cope with the impact of the health crisis. The company\u2019s sales were likely to benefit from the additional liquidity, analysts have said.  \u201cDeere noted signs of stabilization (in farm equipment sales) despite the week farm sentiment,\u201d said Jefferies analyst Stephen Volkmann, adding that fiscal 2020 North American sales outlook of a decline of 10% was \u201csurprisingly benign\u201d.  The company said it expects farm and turf equipment sales to fall between 10% and 15% this year. According to Jefferies, the midpoint is better than a 14% drop estimated by analysts.  Deere typically sees a pick-up in sales of farm equipment after January as farmers start planting fields. That likely helped second-quarter demand for farm machinery hold up better than sales of construction equipment.  It forecast 2020 profit in a range of $1.6 billion to $2 billion, down 39% to 51% from a year earlier.  In the quarter ended May 3, farm and turf machinery sales fell 18% to $5.97 billion and construction and forestry equipment sales dropped 25% to $2.26 billion.

Squabbles over how to organise the ballot during the outbreak plunged Poland into political turmoil, leaving the date of the vote unclear.  Some analysts said Duda\u2019s campaign appears to have lost steam amid political infighting, with the opposition accusing the government of failing to ensure fair and free voting in its preparations for a May 10 ballot.  The ruling nationalists have pushed for the election to be held as soon as possible, wary that a growing economic downturn could erode the chances of Duda, an important ally, to be re-elected.  Government officials say June 28 is now the most likely date.  Support for Duda has fallen 20 percentage points since April, according to a May 18-19 survey by the Kantar pollster, reaching 39%. Another poll, by IBRiS, showed him at 43%.  Duda, one of Poland\u2019s most popular politicians, had polled as high as 63% shortly before the election, his popularity driven in part by an election boycott announced by the biggest opposition party, the centrist Civic Platform (PO).  A PO announcement last week to replace its candidate with popular Warsaw Mayor Rafal Trzaskowski appears to have galvanised centrist voters.  A prominent defender of gay rights, a highly divisive issue in the largely conservative Poland, Trzaskowski could win 18% in the presidential ballot, securing second place, the Kantar poll showed.  Despite falling support, Duda is still likely to secure re-election, the pollster said. If he fails to win more than 50% of vote, he will have to compete with the runner up in a second round.

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also rebuked this week\u2019s move by China\u2019s Communist Party-controlled parliament, calling it arbitrary and disastrous. On Thursday, Republican President Donald Trump warned that Washington would react \u201cvery strongly\u201d against any attempt by Beijing to gain more control over the former British colony.  On CNBC, Biden said, \u201cWe should be calling the rest of the world to condemn their actions, criticizing Trump for a \u201csilence\u201d on human rights issues the former vice president said was \u201cdevastating for people around the world.\u201d  \u201cAll it does is encourage thugs and dictators, which, in fact, I think the president has some kind of affinity for,\u201d Biden said.  China has quickly become a focus in the U.S. presidential race, with both Trump and Biden spending millions of dollars on ad campaigns before Nov. 3\u2019s election targeting each other\u2019s record in dealing with the country.   Trump\u2019s campaign, which has seized on Americans\u2019 growing animosity toward China over the coronavirus outbreak to underpin his re-election pitch, contends Biden will not be as tough on Beijing as the president is.  But Biden argues Trump is helping China by undermining U.S. relations with allies and reducing the United States\u2019 role and influence in international institutions.  China\u2019s action could spark fresh protests in Hong Kong, which enjoys many freedoms not allowed on the mainland, after often-violent demonstrations last year plunged the city into its deepest turmoil since its return to Beijing\u2019s rule in 1997.   Pro-democracy demonstrators have for years opposed the idea of national security laws, arguing they could erode the city\u2019s high degree of autonomy, guaranteed under the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d formula in place for two decades.

Capital city Bogota issued more than $150 million in 10 and 20-year paper on Thursday in a doubly over-subscribed operation.  \u201cBogota will probably be harder hit than the nation on average...that obviously means an income fall this year, an increase in spending,\u201d said city finance secretary Juan Ramirez, predicting an income fall of some 1.3 trillion pesos ($344.4 million) and a contraction of city GDP of up to 8%.

Historically, councils of local and provincial governments have avoided issuing paper which comes due after governments leave office, analysts said.

Company sources told Reuters that the appointments mean BP will be cutting its leadership positions to about 120 from 250, with many veteran executives who held key positions under former CEO Bob Dudley set to leave in the coming months.  In May 14 emails to staff seen by Reuters, Looney named over 100 so-called Tier 2 managers who will form the leadership teams of the 11 divisions he created in February to \u201creinvent\u201d BP and move away from its traditional structure of upstream and downstream units.  \u201cWe expect the reinvented bp to be smaller and nimbler. We have already started by removing a layer of management at Tier 1 and 2,\u201d Looney said in an email to staff.  BP on Friday confirmed to Reuters the management announcements detailed in the emails.   The changes mean that in many cases a whole management layer is being stripped out. For example, Starlee Sykes, who remains head of production for the Gulf of Mexico and Canada, is now two steps removed from Looney whereas before it was three.  The appointments marked Looney\u2019s first 100 days in office, which have been dominated by a collapse in oil prices due to the coronavirus pandemic that has forced energy companies to rein in costs across the board.  In April, BP cut its budget by 25% to $12 billion and said it would find $2.5 billion in cost savings by the end of 2021 through the digitalization and integration of its businesses.  The London-based company, however, maintained its planned $500 million investment in renewables and low-carbon technology amid expectations of only a slow recovery in oil demand.  BP did not provide details about planned job cuts then and told the company\u2019s 70,100 employees that any reductions would be frozen for three months in the wake of the pandemic.  \u201cWe\u2019ll provide more information on the redundancy freeze in June,\u201d Looney said in his email to employees.  BP will provide details of its new long-term strategy at an event for investors in September.  For years, BP\u2019s structure has been dominated by a large oil and gas production division, known as upstream, and a refining, marketing and trading division, known as downstream - as is also the case at many major oil companies.  The new structure with 11 divisions comes into force on July 1 and is designed to help BP shift away from oil and gas towards solar and wind power and low-carbon technologies.  \u201cTogether we will work hard to build a more modern, focused and integrated company - one that is well-positioned to meet the challenges and seize the opportunities that lie ahead,\u201d Looney told staff.  The upstream and downstream divisions now come under one production and operations group headed by Gordon Birrell and including 14 senior managers, according to the announcement.  Among those, Andy Collins, currently head of upstream global operations, was named senior vice president production while Amber Russell, who currently heads BP\u2019s largest refinery in Whiting, Indiana, will head refining operations.   Dave Lawler will retain his role as head of BP\u2019s onshore U.S. shale operations but will also become the company\u2019s U.S. country chair, replacing Susan Dio who will retire.  The gas and low carbon group, led by Dev Sanyal, will see Felipe Arbelaez, currently Latin America regional president, become senior vice president for zero carbon energy. Louise Jacobsen Plutt will lead the hydrogen and carbon capture utilization and storage (CCUS) business.  The customers and products group, led by Emma Delaney and which is set to lead BP\u2019s growing focus on consumers, will include 10 senior managers.  Some of the new management positions will fall under a number of the 11 groups.  For example, Lawler and David Campbell, who retains his role as head of Russia, are in both the production and operations team and William Lin\u2019s team, which aims to help cities and countries develop low-carbon energy infrastructure.  Campbell will also report directly to Looney.  High-profile departures include Michael Townsend, BP\u2019s regional president for the Middle East, and Hesham Mekawi, president for North Africa, as well as Dio.

The \u201cHong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act\u201d approved by U.S. President Donald Trump last year requires the State Department to certify at least annually that Hong Kong retains enough autonomy to justify favorable trading terms that have helped it maintain its position as a world financial center.  Robert O\u2019Brien, Trump\u2019s national security adviser, told Fox News on Thursday Washington has \u201clots of tools to express our displeasure.\u201d Neither he nor Pompeo detailed actions Washington might take.  \u201cThere are privileges that Hong Kong accrues because it\u2019s  considered a free system. We\u2019d have to look over whether those concessions could continue to be made,\u201d he said.  \u201cIf China moves forward and takes strong action under this new national security law ... America will respond, and I think other countries in the world will respond, including the United Kingdom and many other of our allies and friends.\u201d          Former Vice President Joe Biden, Trump\u2019s likely challenger in November\u2019s election, on Friday assailed Trump for what he characterized as his silence on human rights issues.

The ECB has already unveiled a long list of measures to mitigate recession, including 1.1 trillion euros worth of bond buys and loans at deeply negative rates. Policymakers apparently fear this may not be enough.  Arguing that a \u201cV\u201d-shaped recovery was unlikely as movement restrictions may be lengthy, policymakers highlighted flexibility in the bank\u2019s 750 billion euro Pandemic Emergency Purchase Scheme, its flagship bond buying scheme during the crisis.  \u201cIt (the Governing Council) was fully prepared to increase the size of the PEPP and adjust its composition, and potentially its other instruments, if, in the light of information that became available before its June meeting, it judged that the scale of the stimulus was falling short of what was needed,\u201d the ECB said.  While policymakers held back on adjusting bond purchases in April, the accounts are likely to fuel speculation of a move when policymakers next meet on June 4.  Analysts polled by Reuters already expect the ECB to increase bond buy 375 million euros in June with some putting the increase as high at 750 million.  Policymakers are also likely to discuss in June whether to buy corporate bonds that recently lost their investment grade rating and speculation over so-called \u201cfallen angels\u201d may increase after ECB board member Isabel Schnabel highlighted the issue.  \u201cThe number of \u2018fallen angel\u2019 bonds was increasing, while downgrades of high-yield issuers were already much more prominent,\u201d Schnabel told policymakers, according to the minutes.  The ECB already accepts bonds that have been downgraded to junk since April 7 as collateral.  German airline Lufthansa (LHAG.DE) and French carmaker Renault (RENA.PA) were among euro zone companies that lost one of their investment-grade ratings since that date.

Portugal, which has so far recorded 30,200 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 1,289 deaths, is slowly easing restrictions in place since it locked down in mid-March.  It has been less affected than its neighbour Spain or Italy, which both plan to reopen next month.  Many shops and restaurants in Portugal have already reopened under strict restrictions as part of an effort to revive the country\u2019s export-oriented, tourism-dependent economy.  \u201cPortugal\u2019s health system responds well, and this is very important for us to be able to welcome people,\u201d Santos Silva said.  The minister\u2019s comments came a day after British low-cost airline easyJet, which operates in various Portuguese cities, said it would restart a small number of flights next month.  Earlier this month Portugal\u2019s flag carrier TAP resumed some of its international operations, with flights to London and Paris.  Flights to and from outside the European Union are still temporarily suspended until June 15, with some exceptions, including some routes to and from Portuguese-speaking nations like Brazil.   The Spain-Portugal land border, which has been closed to tourists since March, will also remain shut until then.  \u201cWe are gradually going to start looking at easing border controls,\u201d Internal Affairs Minister Eduardo Cabrita said on Friday.  The tourism industry, one of the hardest hit by the outbreak, contributed 14.6% to gross domestic product in 2018, according to the latest official data, and helped Portugal to recover from a severe debt crisis.   The sector registered a 62% slump in the number of people staying in holiday accommodation in March from a year ago and total hotel revenues fell by over 57%.  Unemployment in the Algarve region more than doubled in April compared with the same month last year as the lockdown kept foreign visitors away and wiped out seasonal jobs.

U.S. businesses oppose any change in Washington\u2019s recognition of Hong Kong as a sufficiently autonomous city, where major U.S. companies enjoy access to China and Southeast Asia, and where bilateral trade flourishes across various parts of the economy, from wine to financial services.  A new U.S. law requires the State Department to certify at least annually that Hong Kong, which experienced widespread protests last year over China\u2019s extradition plans, retains enough autonomy to justify favorable U.S. trading terms. President Donald Trump warned on Thursday that Washington could react \u201cvery strongly\u201d to China\u2019s new restrictions.   Here is a look at some of the consequences of a change in that status.  A revocation of the special status would cause problems for the more than 1,300 American companies with business operations in Hong Kong, including nearly every major U.S. financial firm. The State Department said 85,000 U.S. citizens lived in Hong Kong in 2018.  Visa-free travel access to Hong Kong could revert to strict Chinese visa rules, impeding business travel and work visa approvals.  As of 2018, the stock of U.S. foreign direct investment in Hong Kong stood at $82.5 billion, an increase of $1.2 billion that year, according to U.S. Commerce Department data. Hong Kong\u2019s investment in the United States rose $3.5 billion in 2018 to $16.9 billion.  Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy, civil liberties, rule of law and access to China make it attractive to international companies, and a change in that status could push some U.S. firms into costly moves elsewhere in the region.  \u201cNumerous American companies invest in Hong Kong because of its special status, its geographic location and market-based economic system,\u201d the U.S.-China Business Council said in a statement. \u201cAny change to this status quo would irreparably damage American global business interests.\u201d       Some $67 billion in annual Hong Kong-U.S. trade of goods and services could be put at risk as Hong Kong would lose its preferential lower U.S. tariff rate.    Hong Kong is treated separately from mainland China\u2019s more managed economy, and its exports to the United States are treated differently. Hong Kong has a zero tariff rate on imports of U.S. goods, which also could be at risk.  Hong Kong was the source of the largest bilateral U.S. goods trade surplus last year, at $26.1 billion, based on U.S. Census Bureau data.  According to Hong Kong\u2019s Trade and Industry Department, the former British colony in 2018 was the United States\u2019 third-largest export market for wine, its fourth-largest for beef and seventh-largest for all agricultural products.  BROADER U.S.-CHINA RELATIONS  A U.S. revocation of Hong Kong\u2019s special status would be viewed by Beijing as interfering with its sovereignty, and      China has previously threatened to \u201ctake strong countermeasures.\u201d  Eswar Prasad, a trade professor at Cornell University and a former head of the International Monetary Fund\u2019s China department, said Hong Kong is a \u201chot-button\u201d economic and political issue for China, much like U.S. sanctions on Chinese telecoms giant Huawei Technologies Co Ltd.    A precarious U.S.-China trade truce, already strained by Trump\u2019s anger at China over the coronavirus pandemic and a slow start to Beijing\u2019s purchases under the Phase 1 trade deal between the two countries could collapse into new tariffs and counter-sanctions, he said.    The United States also maintains export control offices and academic exchanges in Hong Kong separate from mainland China.

Speaking in an online event hosted by Swiss bank UBS, economic policy director Fabio Kanczuk gave a clear signal that Brazil is reluctant to use the extraordinary policy tools seen across much of the developed world.  Quantitative easing asset purchases, which would lower long-term interest rates, limits the market\u2019s ability to price fiscal risk at the longer end of the rates curve, Kanczuk said. This would only show up elsewhere, most likely in the currency.  \u201cIf we do QE, if we remove the (risk) premium from the curve, it will be reflected in some other financial asset, most notably the exchange rate,\u201d he said.  Brazil\u2019s real has fallen 28% against the dollar this year, with one of the main drags being interest rates falling to a record low 3.0% and expected to fall further.   Facing Brazil\u2019s biggest annual economic downturn since records began in 1900 due to the coronavirus pandemic, calls have increased for the central bank to reduce rates to the so-called \u201clower bound,\u201d effectively zero in developed economies but probably slightly higher in emerging countries.  The central bank has been granted emergency powers to buy government bonds, or conduct QE. But Kanczuk warned that QE and lower-bound interest rates would only raise inflationary pressures, weaken the currency and threaten financial stability.  \u201cQuantitative easing as a monetary policy tool is not what we have in mind. QE would distort (rates) market prices,\u201d he said.  On FX intervention, Kanczuk said the central bank is \u201cprepared\u201d and can tackle any market dysfunction by selling FX swaps or reserves.   Central bank president Roberto Campos Neto said this week the bank has ample room to continue intervening if it sees fit.

But he also dashed a Silicon Valley dream: that tech workers would be able to take their generous salaries with them as they flee the Bay Area\u2019s crushing housing costs, dirty sidewalks and crowded roadways.  As lockdowns dragged into their third month, message boards popular with well-paid tech workers have lit up with fantasies of working long-term from tropical beaches and spacious houses in affordable small towns in the Midwest.  \u201cDoes that mean I could apply for a job in Silicon Valley and work remotely from, say, the Caribbean? Asking for a friend,\u201d wrote one user on Blind, an app designed to let workers swap information anonymously.  Afraid not, Zuckerberg said, addressing employees in a publicly broadcast livestream on his Facebook page.  The company, one of Silicon Valley\u2019s biggest employers, is giving U.S. staffers who are approved to work remotely until Jan. 1, 2021 to update the company on where they plan to base themselves, at which point their salaries will be adjusted to reflect the local cost of living.  Zuckerberg said he expects half of Facebook\u2019s workforce to take him up on the offer over the next five to 10 years.  Employees who attempt to wiggle around those compensation adjustments will be subject to \u201csevere ramifications,\u201d he said, as the company needs to account for employee locations to avoid violating tax laws.  Zuckerberg said Facebook will monitor adherence by checking where employees access its VPN. Facebook also uses its own apps' to track employee locations, according to CNBC here one time using the data to find interns who failed to show up for work.  Even as many tech workers dream of a future in low-tax states, others on message boards fret about how the shift to remote work could exert downward pressure on salaries across the board and warn that being far from headquarters could steepen the climb up the corporate ladder.   One former Facebook employee, who in his 20s lived in Silicon Valley\u2019s suburbs for the short commute, said the change would open up opportunities even for employees who stay in California.  \u201cA 25-year-old maybe would rather be in San Francisco, while someone looking to raise a family might prefer to move outside the city,\u201d he said.  A Facebook spokesman said the company was not planning layoffs, compulsory moves or salary adjustments for employees who opt to stay in the Bay Area.  If the experiment is successful, Facebook\u2019s move could prompt other tech giants to compete for engineering talent by embracing remote work - and other states to compete for Californians.  \u201cThe warm, sunny states with affordable housing and zero taxes will see an influx of educated, rich workers. States will need to cut taxes to keep up,\u201d Chamath Palihapitiya, the chief executive of venture capital firm Social Capital and an early executive at Facebook, said on Twitter.  The biggest loser, he predicted, would be California.

In Saudi Arabia, which lacks a codified legal system and follows Islamic law, forgiveness from a victim\u2019s family in such cases can allow for a formal pardon and a stay of execution.  The murder caused a global uproar and tarnished the image of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Some Western governments, as well as the CIA, said they believed he had ordered the killing.   Saudi officials denied he played a role, though in September 2019 the prince indicated some personal accountability, saying \u201cit happened under my watch\u201d.  The court which issued the five death sentences in December said the killing was not premeditated, a ruling which backed assertions by Saudi officials but which contradicted the findings of a U.N.-led inquiry into Khashoggi\u2019s killing.   Khashoggi was last seen at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2, 2018, where he had gone to obtain documents for his impending wedding. His body was reportedly dismembered and removed from the building, and his remains have not been found.  Eleven suspects in all were put on trial in secretive proceedings in the capital Riyadh. In addition to the five sentenced to death, three were jailed and another three had the charges against them dismissed.  Khashoggi\u2019s son Salah said last December that verdict had been \u201cfair to us and that justice has been achieved.\u201d  However, the trial was condemned by the United Nations and rights groups. Agnes Callamard, the U.N. special rapporteur for extrajudicial summary or arbitrary executions, accused Saudi Arabia of making a \u201cmockery\u201d of justice by allowing the masterminds of the 2018 killing to go free.  A Saudi prosecutor at the time said there was no evidence connecting one of those officials, Saud al-Qahtani, to the killing and dismissed charges against Ahmed al-Asiri, a former deputy intelligence chief.  The Saudi prosecutor had previously said that Qahtani, a former high-profile Saudi royal adviser, had discussed Khashoggi\u2019s activities before he entered the Saudi consulate with the team which went on to hill him. The prosecutor said Qahtani had acted in coordination with Asiri.   On Friday, Callamard criticised the potential pardon.   \u201cThe Saudi authorities are playing out what they hope will be the final act in their well-rehearsed parody of justice in front of an international community far too ready to be deceived,\u201d she posted on Facebook.   Khashoggi\u2019s fiancee Hatice Cengiz also condemned the pardon, tweeting: \u201cNobody has the right to pardon the killers. We will not pardon the killers nor those who ordered the killing,\u201d she said in a tweet.  Salah Khashoggi and his three siblings still live in Saudi Arabia. News reports have said the family received money and real estate from the Saudi ruling family as compensation for Khashoggi\u2019s killing. The family has denied this claim.

In a statement, the U.S. Treasury Department said it had imposed sanctions on Julio Cesar Aviles, Nicaragua\u2019s army commander-in-chief, and Ivan Adolfo Acosta, its finance and public credit minister. The sanctions first appeared on the department\u2019s website.      \u201cThe Ortega regime\u2019s continued violations of basic human rights, blatant corruption, and widespread violence against the Nicaraguan people are unacceptable,\u201d U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement, adding that the United States would continue to \u201ctarget those who prop up the Ortega regime and perpetuate the oppression of the Nicaraguan people.\u201d  U.S. officials have previously targeted Ortega\u2019s leftist government as the Trump administration seeks to increase pressure amid anti-government protests against what critics have said it Ortega\u2019s increasingly authoritarian-style rule.

The Detroit automaker, which resumed production on Monday after suspending operations in March because of the coronavirus pandemic, will launch a second shift next week only at its Lansing Delta Township plant. It will not immediately begin, as it had hoped, second shifts on Monday at its Ft Wayne, Indiana, Flint and Silao, Mexico plants that build full-size trucks, but could resume a second shift as early as later next week, the source said.   GM spokesman Dan Flores said \u201cdemand for our full size picks has been very strong so we are certainly exploring ways to add production and will do that when it makes sense.\u201d  Mexican auto parts production is only this week beginning to slowly resume. GM\u2019s decision to delay resuming some production shifts shows the challenges of resuming production with thousands of suppliers.  GM shares fell 1.2% on Friday in early trading.  Last week, GM suppliers were told the company planned to resume three-shift production at it Fort Wayne plant and other plants as soon as June 1.  Sales of big Detroit brand pickups, particularly in southern and western states less affected by the coronavirus outbreak, have recently significantly outperformed the market, industry executives say.  Large pickups, including Ford\u2019s F-series line, GM\u2019s Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra and Fiat Chrysler\u2019s Ram, accounted for nearly 21% of all light vehicles sold in the United States in April, Ford vice president for U.S. sales, marketing and service Mark LaNeve said earlier this month.

The fast response - well ahead of many other countries facing outbreaks - was the result of merging South Korea\u2019s already advanced methods of collecting information and tracking the virus into a new data sharing system that patches together cellphone location data and credit card records.  The Epidemic Investigation Support System (EISS), introduced in late March, effectively removed technological barriers to sharing that information between authorities, by building on the country\u2019s \u2018Smart City\u2019 data system.  That platform was originally designed to let local authorities share urban planning information, from population to traffic and pollution, by uploading data in Excel spreadsheets and other formats. Now it forms the foundation for a data clearing house that has turbocharged South Korea\u2019s response to the virus.  While personal location and credit card data has been available for use by South Korean health investigators for years, previous systems required physical paperwork to request the data before it was uploaded to analytical software. That took investigators about two to three days to gather a patient\u2019s personal data to trace their contacts.\u00a0  The new system digitizes the entire process, including the requests, and can reduce that time to less than an hour, officials say. Investigators can use it to analyse transmission routes and detect likely infection hotspots.  The system has had some teething problems, and has attracted criticism on privacy grounds, but it has been a major factor in the East Asian nation of 52 million keeping virus infections at a relatively low 11,122, as of Thursday, with just 264 deaths.  It got its first test with an outbreak in May, traced to the Itaewon district of Seoul known for its nightlife, which ended up infecting at least 206 people.  \u201cFaster epidemiological survey means faster discovery of potential patients, which helps contain the spread of the virus even when there\u2019s a massive cluster of infections or people who are asymptomatic, as we\u2019ve seen in the nightclub outbreak,\u201d said Yoon Duk-hee, director for infectious disease management in Gyeonggi Province, a densely populated region near Seoul.  Yoon said she and other authorities used the EISS to trace the movements of the first person detected in the Seoul nightclub outbreak, as he visited a number of places including two nightclubs and three bars.  The system is still reliant on humans operating it to approve and upload data, which can lead to delays. And in some cases, concerns over privacy and security have led to access being so restricted that some local officials said they had to rely on old-fashioned methods.  When another infected person - a 25-year-old man known as Incheon Patient 102 - told health authorities that he did not have a job, city officials said they went to the police because the information they wanted to check was not available in a timely manner on the EISS.  The phone\u2019s location data showed he was a teacher at a private academy, where subsequent contact tracing and testing revealed at least 30 other people had been infected, including some of his students and their parents.  \u201cThere were limitations to the system,\u201d said an official at the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC), on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to the media. \u201cWe are now trying to address them after the Itaewon outbreak.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   The EISS was jointly developed by the KCDC and the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport, with the help of the Korea Electronics Technology Institute (KETI). Many details of how the system works and some limitations of the programme have not previously been reported. A scientific paper on the system was published in a public health journal only on Wednesday.  Authorities\u2019 power to get information was established by a 2015 law called the Infectious Disease Prevention and Control Act, introduced after the country was hit by Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).  The law allows South Korean health officials to access a wide range of personal data, including cellphone location information and credit card transactions, without a court order.  While many countries are scrambling to develop smartphone apps that can trace the contacts of patients without revealing detailed personal information, South Korea has forged ahead with a more invasive approach.  The EISS allows an authorised investigator to log in to a secure web portal and send information requests about specific confirmed cases. Police agencies must approve requests for location data from three telecommunications operators, while the Credit Finance Association handles approval for information from 22 credit card companies.   When a request is approved, designated officials at the companies receive alerts on their phones and computers. They then upload individuals\u2019 data in an Excel spreadsheet.  The investigator then has temporary access to the information to conduct analysis. There are usually more than 10,000 location data points for each person in a typical 14-day period being analysed, according to the KCDC.  An EISS web portal seen by Reuters showed an interactive map displaying patient movements, with each location data point indicating whether it was collected via credit card or cellphone.  The government says access is restricted and authorized investigators must log in through a virtual private network (VPN) and use two-factor authentication to prevent security breaches.  Officials told Reuters that developers of the system had considered using surveillance footage and even facial recognition as part of the data the system could access, but decided against it because of privacy concerns. While CCTV is not accessed or uploaded to the EISS portal, health investigators still widely use such footage to track cases.  \u201cWe spent more time agonising over privacy than on developing the system,\u201d said Park Young-joon, a director at the KCDC.  Still, the system has raised concerns over its use of private data.  \u201cIt represents a rare non-judicial, non-consensual acquisition of location data, with no judicial oversight for the data collected,\u201d said Deborah Brown, a digital rights researcher with the U.S.-based Human Rights Watch. \u201cThere\u2019s a concern that the door is open to abuse.\u201d  South Korean officials told Reuters that data on almost every person confirmed to have the virus is entered into the system to allow cross-referencing and analysis of likely hotspots. The KCDC declined to say how many people\u2019s data has been collected in all.  People do not have any choice whether their data is collected and accessed, but officials told Reuters that authorities notify anyone whose information is gathered and that all the data will be deleted when the virus is contained.  \u201cSuch information should only be used for crises like infectious diseases,\u201d said Gyeonggi Province Governor Lee Jae-myung. \u201cBut thankfully our people understand that it is inevitable in battling the pandemic.\u201d  At a national or global level, lives are more important than personal privacy, said a 64-year-old South Korean woman who asked only to be identified by her surname Jang. \u201cPersonal privacy is important, but preventing an infectious disease is even more so.\u201d  Some local health investigators said that access to the EISS has been too restricted or too slow, so they have gone back to traditional ways of requesting data.  One Incheon health official told Reuters the city did not initially use EISS on Incheon Patient 102 because it took too long to get the person registered.  Those concerns have since been addressed by changes that\u00a0will allow local agencies to register patients themselves rather than waiting for the KCDC, said Kim Jae-ho, a director at KETI.  Travel information and medical records may be added to the system, two people working on the project told Reuters. South Korean health ministry official Yoon Tae-ho said at a briefing that they are also looking at the use of Bluetooth and QR codes to log places people visit - such as nightclubs.  There was \u201can inertia in administrative process,\u201d the first KCDC official told Reuters. \u201cBut now I am swamped with calls from the local governments about how to use the system.\u201d  Reporting by Hyonhee Shin, Hyunjoo Jin and Josh Smith in Seoul; Editing by Jonathan Weber and Bill Rigby","84":"(Reuters) - Unemployment rates rose and total employment fell in all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia in April as efforts to contain the coronavirus pandemic forced businesses to close across the country, the Labor Department said on Friday.  The department\u2019s Bureau of Labor Statistics said 43 states set record-high rates of unemployment last month, with the highest being in Nevada, the state with the greatest reliance on the hard-hit food services and hospitality industry. Nevada\u2019s jobless rate surged by 21.3 percentage points from March to 28.2%, which was nearly double the national rate of 14.7% in April.  The monthly breakdown of state-level nonfarm employment and jobless rates, published two weeks after the national payrolls report, painted a picture of widespread but nonetheless uneven devastation caused by the spread of COVID-19, the respiratory illness triggered by the novel coronavirus.  The May 8 payrolls report showed a record 20.5 million jobs were lost in April, the steepest plunge in U.S. employment since the Great Depression.  Friday\u2019s report indicated more than a quarter of those job losses were concentrated in three of the largest U.S. states: California, which shed 2.3 million jobs; New York, which has seen the largest number of U.S. COVID-19 cases and deaths and lost 1.8 million positions; and Texas, which has suffered a double blow from plunging oil prices and lost 1.3 million jobs.  In Nevada, home to the global gambling mecca of Las Vegas, half of the nearly 245,000 jobs lost in April were in the leisure and hospitality sector. That industry has suffered the greatest losses nationally from the reductions in travel and widespread closures of dine-in restaurants during a month when stay-at-home orders were deployed broadly.  The leisure and hospitality sector losses also took a major toll on Hawaii, which was one of only three states with an unemployment rate above 20% - Nevada and Michigan were the other two. The Pacific island state lost more than 55% of leisure and hospitality jobs last month, accounting for 57% of all jobs lost in that period.  In Michigan, more than one of every five jobs was eliminated, at least temporarily. The leisure and hospitality sector led the declines there, too, but a quarter of the state\u2019s losses came in the manufacturing and construction sectors.  Layoffs have persisted in May even as all 50 states have reopened businesses to one degree or another. On Thursday, the BLS reported more than 2.4 million people filed for unemployment benefits for the first time last week and those continuing to receive jobless relief payments topped 25 million in the week ended May 9.  That data suggests the worst may not be over for the hardest-hit states such as Nevada, Hawaii and Michigan. The number of continued claims rose in all three, including a 31% week-over-week increase in Hawaii.  Economists believe that progress in driving down infection rates will be an important factor behind the success of state re-opening efforts.   On that front, at least, both Hawaii and Nevada appear to be leaders, and they are among just eight states to have shown three straight weeks of declines in the 7-day average of new cases. Michigan is among 20 states that have seen declines in two of the past three weeks.

The company said it would ask its lawyers \u201cto evaluate all the actions necessary... in view of the serious damage being caused\u201d the group and to its Autostrade per l\u2019Italia unit.  Autostrade is in talks for a state-guaranteed loan worth up to 1.25 billion euros to weather the fall in motorway traffic triggered by the coronavirus crisis.  A representative of the ruling coalition 5-Star Movement, which has been pushing for Autostrade\u2019s highway concession to be revoked ever since a bridge it operated collapsed and killed 43 people, said the loan guarantee should not be given.  \u201cYou have the right to ask, and to answer is a courtesy. NO, thanks,\u201d Deputy Industry Minister Stefano Buffagni wrote in a post on Facebook on Wednesday.  While waiting for the state-backed loan, Autostrade could use a 900 million euro ($980 million) credit line granted by its parent company to cope with \u201cserious financial tensions\u201d, Atlantia said on Friday.  Rome approved a decree in April offering state guarantees on up to 400 billion euros in new bank loans.       The emergency legislation allows the Treasury to introduce additional requirements, and 5-Star wants Rome to use this option to impose draconian conditions on the company, one party source told Reuters.   It remains to be seen whether the centre-left PD party, which governs with 5-Star, will back its coalition ally in trying to block the loan.  Autostrade\u2019s executives will meet with the Treasury next week to discuss the state-backed loan, a third source said.  In addition to Autostrade, three other companies controlled by the Benettons are interested in state-backed loans, bringing the total potential requests to more than 1.8 billion euros.  Disagreement over the group\u2019s request for state-backed funds has reignited tensions with Rome over the potential revocation of it motorway concession.     Atlantia also complained the government had not yet replied to a 2.9 billion euro proposal filed by Autostrade at the start  of March to end the row over the concession.  \u201cThis situation has caused, and continues to cause, serious damage to the group as a whole and has given rise to concern among investors,\u201d it said.

Fuel demand plummeted as the coronavirus pandemic caused governments to impose restrictions on movement and businesses closed their doors.   Oil has rallied in recent days as activity starts to resume, but prices dropped after China said on Friday it would not publish an annual growth target for the first time. Beijing  also pledged more government spending as the pandemic kept hammering the economy.  \u201cThe coronavirus has nullified a decade of global oil demand growth and the recovery will be slow,\u201d said Stephen Brennock of broker PVM.  Brent crude futures fell 93 cents, or 2.6%, to settle at $35.13 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude ended 67 cents, or 2%, lower at $33.25 a barrel.  China is set to impose new national security legislation on Hong Kong after last year\u2019s pro-democracy unrest, a Chinese official said on Thursday, drawing a warning from President Donald Trump that Washington would react \u201cvery strongly.\u201d  For the week, Brent and WTI gained 8% and 13%, respectively, but some said they may have come too far, too fast.  \u201cA second wave (of the coronavirus) is not such a remote possibility and a new round of lockdowns could send prices back to much lower levels very quickly, and the market knows it,\u201d said Rystad Energy senior oil markets analyst Paola Rodriguez Masiu.  Oil prices have plummeted more than 40% so far in 2020, rebounding in part due to efforts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies to reduce supply.

The deficit excluding interest payments for the Treasury, central bank and social security is more than four times wider than the 124.1 billion reais shortfall originally projected at the start of the year.  Due to the economic and public health crisis, the government was exempted from meeting that target, and the Economy Ministry\u2019s previous bimonthly revenue and expenditure report in March penciled in a deficit goal of 161.6 billion reais.  In its latest report on Friday, the ministry lowered its 2020 revenue estimate by 111.2 billion reais to 1.21 trillion reais, and raised its primary spending forecast by 267.7 bln reais to 1.75 trillion reais.  Brazil\u2019s economy is on course for its steepest annual downturn since records began in 1900. The government expects GDP to contract by 4.7%. The consensus in the central bank\u2019s latest weekly survey of economists is for a 5.1% fall.  These predictions may already look optimistic. Swiss bank UBS on Thursday became the latest in a clutch of banks to slash their GDP forecast to show a fall of 7% or more.   Using the Economy Ministry\u2019s own estimate for a 7.15 trillion reais economy this year, the 540.5 bln reais deficit would be worth around 7.5% of gross domestic product.  Treasury Secretary Mansueto Almeida had said this week that the primary budget deficit could end up exceeding 700 billion reais, or more than 9% of GDP.  The Economy Ministry said on Thursday that emergency spending measures will have a 344.6 billion reais impact on this year\u2019s primary budget balance.  Separately, federal tax revenues slumped 29% in April to 101.15 billion reais the lowest tax take for that month since records began in 2007.

The Argentine ambassador to the United States wrote in a letter obtained by Reuters that the country would miss the Friday bond payments given the \u201cprospect of reaching an agreement with its creditors on new terms for their bonds.  \u201cArgentina will postpone this payment until an agreement is reached with creditors and new terms are agreed upon on the interests to be paid on said bonds,\u201d Ambassador Jorge Arg\u00fcello wrote.  Argentina\u2019s Economy Ministry said in a statement attributed to Economy Minister Martin Guzman that the interest payment was part of wider restructuring discussion \u201cand we expect it to be addressed in the broader agreement that we are pursuing.\u201d  Reuters could not immediately reach officials at the Argentine embassy in the United States for comment.  The likely default on three bonds occurs in the context of negotiations to revamp around $65 billion in foreign debt with a new deadline for a deal delayed on Thursday to June 2 amid signs the two sides may be warily edging closer to an accord.  Argentina and its creditors, which have traded proposals over the last month, have indicated they are eager to avoid a messy default that could spark years of litigation and lock the major grains-producing country out of global capital markets.  Guzman told Reuters late on Thursday the government planned to amend its offer to creditors and that talks were on a positive course, though there remained an \u201cimportant distance\u201d to reach a deal.  \u201cThese are critical times. What\u2019s achieved now will affect the lives of millions of people and will likely\u00a0have spillover effects on an entire class of assets,\u201d he said.  Creditors also have shown signs of flexibility and indicated they are unlikely to take immediate action against Argentina over any default, as long as talks are on the right course.  A major creditor group holding around $16.7 billion of Argentina\u2019s international bonds said on Friday that while failure to pay would trigger defaults on various bonds, it recognized Argentina was seeking a comprehensive deal.  The Ad Hoc Bondholder Group, including names like Ashmore, BlackRock and AllianceBernstein, cautioned that it wanted more engagement from Argentina, which it said was still lacking.  \u201cThe Group welcomes Argentina\u2019s expression of an intent to work with creditors, but actions speak louder than words,\u201d it said in a statement. \u201cOver the last month, Argentina has had virtually no substantive engagement with its creditors.\u201d  The Argentina Creditor Committee, another of the main groups, said on Friday it objected to Argentina\u2019s decision to default on its international bonds, though it remained committed to seeking a successful restructuring deal.  \u201cThis latest default, if not promptly resolved, will prevent access to the international capital markets needed for the recovery of the Argentine economy and therefore will be detrimental to the Argentine people.\u201d  The Economist Intelligence Unit\u2019s regional director for Latin America and the Caribbean, Fiona Mackie, said in a note that a default would make reaching a deal even more pivotal for Argentina\u2019s economy, already stuck in recession for two years.  \u201cWithout it, Argentina faces a troubling outlook not just this year, but for several years to come,\u201d she wrote, adding that fears of losing access to credit markets would spur the government to strike a deal.  \u201cThe alternative is grim, and includes the growing risk of a hyperinflationary spiral all while economic activity remains subdued by financing constraints,\u201d she said.

The move is seen as a turning point, as leaders of the ruling Communist Party tighten control over China\u2019s freest international city, undermining its reputation as a financial hub with substantial autonomy and an independent legal system.  Greater control and a sense of security. For several years, Chinese officials have expressed increasing frustration and anger over what they see as a weak national security regime in the freewheeling city.  Last year\u2019s large and sometimes violent anti-government protests have sharpened that frustration, with China determined to thwart what it calls threats of terrorism, independence, subversion of state power, and interference by foreign forces.  China\u2019s annual session of parliament will deliberate on the plan, announced on Thursday, before it is grafted into Hong Kong\u2019s mini-constitution without any local legislative scrutiny, as has been past practice.  In the draft of the legislation seen by Reuters, China said its move follows \u201cincreasingly notable national security risks\u201d. It said Hong Kong had failed to implement national security laws on its own as stipulated in the city\u2019s mini-constitution, under the terms of its 1997 handover from Britain.  Hong Kong lawyers are puzzled over how the imposed provisions will work in practice.  Questions include whether all protections already in the Basic Law apply and whether locally based mainland agents have enforcement power.  Another issue is whether the standing committee of the National People\u2019s Congress has extra powers to ultimately interpret Hong Kong court rulings on national security.  \u201cThe ground is shifting beneath our feet,\u201d one legal scholar said. \u201cThere are suddenly a lot more questions than answers. And it is not even clear whether anyone in the Hong Kong government is standing up internally against these changes.\u201d  China also said its intelligence agencies would have the right to set up offices in Hong Kong to \u201csafeguard national security\u201d. It is not clear, however, whether, they will carry out enforcement activities, a critical concern.      The issue sits at the heart of the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d formula under which China agreed to protect Hong Kong\u2019s extensive freedoms, autonomy and independent legal system.  Those freedoms are protected by the Basic Law, which guides the relationship between Hong Kong and Beijing.  But Article 23 of the document also says Hong Kong must \u201con its own\u201d enact laws against treason, secession, sedition, subversion and the theft of state secrets. It also seeks to outlaw ties between local and foreign political groups.  The Hong Kong government proposed such local legislation in 2003 but encountered vast opposition, with more than 500,000 people marching peacefully against it.   However the Basic Law also gives Beijing the power to annex national laws into the document - which the local government must then legislate for or effectively impose by executive fiat.   Hong Kong lawyers and politicians sometimes call this the \u201cnuclear option\u201d, but some scholars have questioned whether this power of promulgation applies to Article 23.  Yes. Britain left behind a raft of old laws covering most of the elements of Article 23, aside from subversion and secession - the act of formally withdrawing from a state.   Most are decades old and lawyers say they would be hard to deploy, given more recent protections on freedoms of speech, assembly and association written into the city\u2019s Bill of Rights and the Basic Law itself.  Highly. Given Hong Kong\u2019s protest movements and polarised politics, a fresh push even for local legislation would be tough.  Many fear that new national security legislation would prove a \u201cdead hand\u201d on the city\u2019s large and pugnacious press and rich artistic traditions, while curbing its broad political debates.    Any step by Beijing to impose its own version via promulgation risks panic and chaos, many observers believe, potentially sparking a flight of people and capital and denting Hong Kong\u2019s international financial role.  \u201cAny effort to impose draconian national security legislation on Hong Kong would be inconsistent with Beijing\u2019s promises, and would impact American interests there,\u201d U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said late in April.

Communist Party rulers in Beijing on Friday unveiled details of the legislation that critics see as a turning point for the former British colony, which enjoys many freedoms, including an independent legal system and right to protest, not allowed on the mainland.  Pro-democracy activists and politicians have for years opposed such legislation, arguing it could erode its autonomy, guaranteed under the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d agreement under which Britain returned Hong Kong to China in 1997.  \u201cBeijing is attempting to silence Hong Kongers\u2019 critical voices with force and fear,\u201d activist Joshua Wong, one of the leaders of pro-democracy street protests in 2014, tweeted.  Hong Kong activists called for people to rise up against the proposal, aimed at tackling secession, subversion, terrorism, and foreign interference, that has sent shockwaves across the business and diplomatic communities.  Foreign diplomats fear establishing new Beijing agencies in Hong Kong could give mainland security and intelligence officers enforcement powers.  \u201cThis is a great moment to reboot the protest,\u201d said university student Kay, 24, who took part in last year\u2019s often violent anti-government and anti-Beijing unrest, with protesters angry at perceived meddling by China with Hong Kong\u2019s freedoms, a charge Beijing denies.

Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said her government will \u201cfully cooperate\u201d with the Chinese parliament to safeguard national security, which she said would not affect rights, freedoms or judicial independence.  The proposals have heightened tensions between Beijing and Washington, whose relationship is already frayed by trade disputes and reciprocal accusations over handling of the pandemic.  U.S. President Donald Trump warned Washington would react \u201cvery strongly\u201d if Beijing went ahead with the security law.  U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the \u201cdisastrous proposal\u201d would be the \u201cdeath knell\u201d for Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy and that the United States stood with the people of Hong Kong.  \u201cThe United States strongly urges Beijing to reconsider its disastrous proposal, abide by its international obligations, and respect Hong Kong\u2019s high degree of autonomy, democratic institutions, and civil liberties, which are key to preserving its special status under U.S. law,\u201d he said.  Hong Kong\u2019s last colonial governor, Chris Patten, told Channel 4 television that party rulers in Beijing were a \u201cfrightened lot of bullies\u201d.  \u201cYou cannot trust (President) Xi Jinping\u2019s China.

In his annual report to parliament, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said China would establish a \u201csound\u201d legal system and enforcement mechanisms to ensure national security in Hong Kong and Macau, a former Portuguese colony that returned to China in 1999.  The proposed move will see China\u2019s parliament endorse, then annex the laws into Hong Kong\u2019s mini-constitution, the Basic Law, without any local legislative scrutiny, according to a draft seen by Reuters.  The document said the laws will safeguard the central government\u2019s \u201coverall jurisdiction\u201d as well as Hong Kong\u2019s \u201chigh autonomy\u201d given Hong Kong\u2019s \u201cincreasingly notable national security risks\u201d.  \u201cWhen needed, relevant national security organs of the Central People\u2019s Government will set up agencies\u201d in Hong Kong to safeguard national security, the draft said.  Hong Kong\u2019s judiciary, along with the government and legislature, must \u201ceffectively prevent, stop and punish acts endangering national security\u201d, it states. The reference to Hong Kong\u2019s staunchly independent legal system has rattled some Hong Kong lawyers.   A previous attempt to adopt similar legislation in 2003 was met with a protest that drew around half a million people on to the streets and was eventually shelved.  \u201cIt is essentially declaring directly that \u2018one country, two systems\u2019 is null and a failure,\u201d said Eric Cheung, principal lecturer at Hong Kong University\u2019s department of law, of the legislation.

The default on three bonds came as negotiations to revamp around $65 billion in foreign debt revved up, with Economy Minister Martin Guzman saying talks were on a positive course despite an \u201cimportance distance\u201d left to reach a deal.  A source close to the talks and familiar with the government\u2019s thinking separately told Reuters that the two sides were making substantial progress and that a comprehensive deal was possible in a \u201cmatter of days, not months\u201d.  Argentina and its creditors, which have traded proposals over the last month, have indicated they are eager to avoid a messy default that could spark years of litigation and lock the major grains-producing country out of global capital markets.  The country has pushed the deadline for a deal to June 2 amid signs the two sides may be edging closer to an accord.  The default could however complicate things.  \u201cArgentina today failed to pay $503 million in interest which was originally due on April 22,\u201d Gabriel Torres, a Moody\u2019s vice president said in a statement, adding it was consistent with the agency\u2019s current sovereign credit view on the country.  \u201cWe expect the road ahead for Argentina\u2019s debt restructuring is likely to become more problematic.\u201d  Argentina\u2019s ambassador to the United States had earlier written in a letter obtained by Reuters that the country would miss the Friday payments given the \u201cprospect of reaching an agreement with its creditors on new terms for their bonds.\u201d  Guzman said in a statement the interest payment was part of wider restructuring discussion \u201cand we expect it to be addressed in the broader agreement that we are pursuing.\u201d  The minister told Reuters late on Thursday the government planned to amend its offer to creditors based on negotiations over the coming days.   \u201cThese are critical times. What\u2019s achieved now will affect the lives of millions of people and will likely\u00a0have spillover effects on an entire class of assets,\u201d he said.  Creditors also have shown signs of flexibility and indicated they are unlikely to take immediate action against Argentina over any default, as long as talks are on the right course.  A major creditor group holding around $16.7 billion of Argentina\u2019s international bonds said that while failure to pay would trigger defaults on various bonds, it recognized Argentina was seeking a comprehensive deal.  The Ad Hoc Bondholder Group, including names like Ashmore, BlackRock and AllianceBernstein, cautioned that it wanted more engagement from Argentina, which it said was still lacking.  \u201cThe Group welcomes Argentina\u2019s expression of an intent to work with creditors, but actions speak louder than words,\u201d it said. \u201cOver the last month, Argentina has had virtually no substantive engagement with its creditors.\u201d  The Argentina Creditor Committee, another of the main groups, said it objected to Argentina\u2019s decision to default on its international bonds, though it remained committed to seeking a successful restructuring deal.  \u201cThis latest default, if not promptly resolved, will prevent access to the international capital markets needed for the recovery of the Argentine economy and therefore will be detrimental to the Argentine people.\u201d  The Economist Intelligence Unit\u2019s regional director for Latin America and the Caribbean, Fiona Mackie, said in a note that a default would make reaching a deal even more pivotal for Argentina\u2019s economy, already stuck in recession for two years.  \u201cWithout it, Argentina faces a troubling outlook not just this year, but for several years to come,\u201d she wrote, adding that fears of losing access to credit markets would spur the government to strike a deal.  \u201cThe alternative is grim, and includes the growing risk of a hyperinflationary spiral all while economic activity remains subdued by financing constraints,\u201d she said.

All international arrivals, including returning Britons, will have to self-isolate for 14 days and provide details of where they will be staying under the plans, which were criticised by airlines, business groups and politicians alike.  \u201cNow we are past the peak of this virus, we must take steps to guard against imported cases triggering a resurgence of this deadly disease,\u201d Patel said at a news conference.  Those who breached the quarantine in England could be fined 1,000 pounds ($1,218), and spot checks would be carried out by health and border officials.      The quarantine will not apply to those arriving from the Irish Republic, nor to freight drivers, medical professionals and seasonal agricultural workers. The measures will be reviewed every 3 weeks. [nL8N2D44UM]  Transport minister Grant Shapps has also suggested the government would seek to negotiate \u201cair bridges\u201d for travellers coming from countries with low virus infection rates.  Unlike many other countries, Britain has carried out few tests and checks on visitors, with quarantine limited only to arrivals from China at the start of the outbreak.  Spain and Italy have introduced rules that mean international arrivals must self-isolate for two weeks, while on Friday Ireland gave further details for its own quarantine proposals. [L8N2D44ZQ]  The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said the blanket quarantine was deeply concerning and could be avoided with strong safety measures.  \u201cThis approach will damage international business and investor confidence at a time when it is vital to demonstrate that the UK can open for business safely,\u201d BCC Director General Adam Marshall said.

Below are details of the scheme:  Everyone arriving in the UK will be required to self-isolate for 14 days except those on a list of \u201climited exemptions\u201d, which the government said it would publish later.   Those exempt will include:  - road haulage and freight workers  - medical professionals who are travelling to help with the fight against the coronavirus  - anyone moving from within the Common Travel Area, which covers Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man  - Seasonal agricultural workers will be able to self-isolate on the property where they are working  The government said it would also continue to look at the option of things such as air bridges - agreements between countries who both have low transmission rates to remove the need for quarantine measures.  All arriving passengers will have to fill in an online contact form providing details and travel information so they can be contacted if they, or someone they may have been in contact with, develops the disease.  This will include giving details of their self-isolation accommodation and if it does not meet the necessary requirements, they will be required to self-isolate in facilities arranged by the government, at the passenger\u2019s expense.  The government said people should use personal transport, such as a car, to travel to their accommodation where possible.  Once there, they should not go to work, school, or public areas, or use public transport or taxis. They should not have visitors, including friends and family, unless they are providing essential support.  They should also not go out to buy food or other essentials where they can rely on others.  The new regime will be in place across the United Kingdom, although enforcement measures will be set individually by each of the devolved nations.  In England, a breach of the self-isolation rules would be punishable with a 1,000 pound fine or potential prosecution and unlimited fine. The level of fine could increase if the risk of infection from abroad increases.     Border Force may refuse entry to any non-British citizen who refuses to comply with these regulations and is not resident in the UK.  Failure to complete the contact form is punishable by a 100 pound fine. The government said public health authorities would conduct random checks in England to ensure compliance and  removal from the country would be considered as a last resort for foreign nationals who refuse to follow the rules.  The rules will come into force on June 8 and will be reviewed every three weeks.  The government said that as the rate of infection in the United Kingdom falls and the number of travellers arriving in the country begins to increase, imported cases could become a higher proportion of the overall number of infections in the UK and risk a second wave of the virus.

The omission from Premier Li Keqiang\u2019s work report marks the first time China has not set a target for gross domestic product (GDP) since the government began publishing such goals in 1990.   The economy shrank 6.8% in the first quarter, the first contraction in decades, hit by the outbreak of the new coronavirus, which started in the central Chinese city of Wuhan.   \u201cWe have not set a specific target for economic growth for the year, mainly because the global epidemic situation and economic and trade situation are very uncertain, and China\u2019s development is facing some unpredictable factors,\u201d Li said at the start of parliament.   Domestic consumption, investment and exports are falling, and the pressure on employment is rising significantly, while financial risks are mounting, he warned.   China has set a target to create over 9 million urban jobs this year, according to Li\u2019s report, down from a goal of at least 11 million in 2019 and the lowest since 2013.   Ahead of the National People\u2019s Congress, the week-long meeting of the largely rubber-stamp parliament, China\u2019s top leaders have promised to boost stimulus to bolster the economy amid rising worries job losses could threaten social stability.   Beijing is also planning security legislation for Hong Kong, which Li said will provide a \u201csound\u201d legal system and enforcement mechanisms but which critics say could curb autonomy in the city.   The move drew warnings from the United States, falls on Asian stock markets and calls among Hong Kong activists for protests in the former British colony.  China is targeting a 2020 budget deficit of at least 3.6% of GDP, above last year\u2019s 2.8%, and fixed the quota on local-government special bond issuance at 3.75 trillion yuan ($527 billion), up from 2.15 trillion yuan, according to Li.  The government will issue 1 trillion yuan in special treasury bonds this year, the first such issuance. It will transfer 2 trillion yuan raised from the bigger 2020 budget deficit and special anti-coronavirus treasury bonds to local governments, Li said.  Local government bonds could be used to fund infrastructure projects, while special treasury bonds could be used to support firms and regions hit by the outbreak.   The fiscal stimulus in Li\u2019s report is equivalent to about 4.1% of China\u2019s GDP, according to Reuters calculations based on the fiscal measures announced.  \u201cThe annual budget points to fiscal stimulus this year at least on par with that following the global financial crisis,\u201d Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a note.  But Nie Wen, economist at Shanghai-based Hwabao Trust, said Li\u2019s report indicates China will \u201cnot resort to mass stimulus that some market players have been betting on.\u201d  Nie expects GDP growth to slow sharply this year to around 2% or 3% from last year\u2019s 6.1%.   \u201cThis year\u2019s economic growth needs to reach around 3% to create 9 million new urban jobs,\u201d Nie said, adding that the size of the fiscal stimulus announced by Li is about 4 trillion yuan.   In line with the slower economy, China will raise defence spending by 6.6% this year, the slowest in three decades, while the budget for environmental protection will increase a modest 4%.  Monetary policy will be more flexible, Li said, adding that growth in M2 - a broad gauge of money supply - and total social financing will be significantly higher this year.   The People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC) will guide its benchmark lending rate lower, he said.   The central bank has cut the Loan Prime Rate (LPR) by 46 basis points since August 2019, when it replaced the previous benchmark lending rate. The one-year LPR rate is now 3.85%.  The PBOC has cut reserve requirement ratios 10 times since early 2018, including three cuts this year.  Small and midsize companies can delay paying loans and interest by a further nine months, through March 2021, and lending to SMEs by big commercial banks should grow more than 40%, Li said.       The tax and fee burden shouldered by companies will be cut by 2.5 trillion yuan this year, Li said.

The likely Democratic nominee\u2019s remarks to \u201cThe Breakfast Club\u201d co-host Charlamagne tha God in an interview broadcast on Friday drew a swift rebuke from the Trump campaign and Republican supporters, as well as some black Democrats on Twitter.  \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have been such a wise guy,\u201d Biden said on a subsequent call with the U.S. Black Chambers Inc, an African-American business group. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have been so cavalier.\u201d  Biden, who served eight years as No. 2 to President Barack Obama, the first black U.S. president, added he has never taken black voters for granted and that no one should have to vote for somebody.   During the radio interview, recorded on Thursday, the popular host had challenged Biden over his long history on race issues.  As Charlamagne pressed Biden about whether he would select an African-American woman as vice president, a campaign aide could be heard trying to end the interview.   \u201cYou can\u2019t do that to black media!\u201d the radio host said.  Biden responded, \u201cI do that to white media and black media because my wife has to go on at 6 o\u2019clock.\u201d   Charlamagne invited Biden back to the show, saying he had more questions ahead of the election.  \u201cYou\u2019ve got more questions?\u201d Biden replied. \u201cWell, I tell you what, if you have a problem figuring out whether you\u2019re for me or Trump, then you ain\u2019t black.\u201d  Biden called his record on racial issues \u201csecond to none.\u201d He and Charlamagne agreed he would come back on the show another time.  Before the apology, the Trump campaign organized a conference call with reporters where U.S. Senator Tim Scott, who is black, said Biden\u2019s comments were \u201carrogant and demeaning\u201d and \u201cnegative race-baiting rhetoric.\u201d   Biden adviser Symone Sanders said in a tweet that the remarks were made in jest.  \u201cHe was making the distinction that he would put his record with the African American community up against Trump\u2019s any day.

The government said there would be some exemptions, including road haulage and freight workers, medical professionals travelling to help with the fight against the coronavirus and those coming from Ireland.  \u201cNow we are past the peak of this virus, we must take steps to guard against imported cases triggering a resurgence of this deadly disease,\u201d Patel said at the government\u2019s daily news conference.

Speaking in an online event hosted by business group Lide Pernambuco, Almeida\u2019s comments came shortly after the Economy Ministry revised its primary deficit forecast for central government, a slightly narrower measure, to 540 billion reais.

Prosecutors said William Sadleir, 66, diverted much of the $1.7 million of loans he received on May 1 from the Paycheck Protection Program for personal expenses.  He allegedly did this after falsely telling JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) and the Small Business Administration the funds were meant for his former company Aviron Group, which had terminated him in December and where he has no current role.  The PPP was meant \u201cto help small businesses stay afloat during the financial crisis, and we will act swiftly against those who abuse the program for their own personal gain,\u201d U.S. Attorney Nick Hanna in Los Angeles said in a statement.  Sadleir was also accused of having previously induced the closed-end BlackRock Multi-Sector Income Trust Fund (BIT.N) to invest $75 million in Aviron to support its films.  Prosecutors said he then created a sham company to conceal his use of the money, and assumed the fake identity \u201cAmanda Stevens\u201d to communicate by email with the BlackRock fund about its investment.  In a related civil case, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said Sadleir\u2019s \u201clavish lifestyle\u201d also included a $127,000 Tesla.  A lawyer for Sadleir could not immediately be identified. A BlackRock spokesman declined to comment.  Aviron\u2019s films have included Halle Berry\u2019s \u201cKidnap\u201d and Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway\u2019s \u201cSerenity.\u201d  The BlackRock fund had $574 million of assets as of May 21, and normally invests most assets in debt and loans. It sued Sadleir for fraud in a New York state court in December.  Sadleir faces up to 124 years in prison if convicted on all charges.

In his daily news conference, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the federal government was already helping Ontario, the most populous province, with contact tracing and was open to do the same for the other 12 provinces and territories.  Businesses and citizens \u201cneed to know that we have a coordinated approach to gradually reopen that is rooted in science, evidence and the ability to rapidly detect and control any future outbreaks,\u201d Trudeau said.  The western province of Alberta said on Friday it would test anyone in long-term care facilities, where most of the deaths have been recorded, even if they have no symptoms.  Canada\u2019s total cases rose to 81,765 on Friday, and deaths were up less than 2% to 6,180, official data showed.   With contagion slowing, provinces have been gradually reopening in recent weeks.   On Friday, Quebec said museums, libraries and drive-in movie theaters can open from May 29. In Calgary, the biggest city in Alberta, barber shops and hairstylists can restart from May 25, and restaurants and bars will be able to offer table service at half capacity.  On May 1, Alberta rolled out a digital-tracing tool to monitor outbreaks.  The apps are meant to help trace and call people who have come into contact with an individual infected with COVID-19.  Trudeau had not promoted the use of a tracing app, but on Friday he said the government was working \u201cclosely\u201d with Apple and Google and would \u201cstrongly recommend\u201d one as soon as their tracing technology is ready.  Critics are concerned that it will undermine civil liberties and privacy.
