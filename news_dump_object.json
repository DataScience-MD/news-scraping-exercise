jumped on Monday, and the S&P 500 closed at a 10-week high, on encouraging early-stage data for a potential coronavirus vaccine and on the promise of more stimulus to lift an economy beaten down by the pandemic.  Drugmaker Moderna Inc (MRNA.O) surged 19.96% after the company said its experimental COVID-19 vaccine showed promising results in a small early-stage trial.  After rallying more than 32% from a multi-year low hit in March, the S&P 500 had been trading in a tight range in May as investors weighed the hopes of an economic recovery against the fears of another wave of infection as states lifted virus-led restrictions.  \u201cThe fact that Moderna came out with the Phase 1 trial that seems to be positive, that certainly is igniting the storm,\u201d said Ken Polcari, chief market strategist at SlateStone Wealth LLC in Jupiter, Florida. \u201cThat will ignite the storm because if there is a vaccine then all this uncertainty about the economy and the virus goes away.\u201d   Stocks that have been particularly battered by government lockdown measures implemented to stem the spread of the coronavirus surged on Monday.   Travel-related stocks were among the biggest gainers, with cruise line operators Carnival Corp (CCL.N), Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd (NCLH.N) all outperforming the broader market with gains of at least 15%.   Airline stocks also soared as Delta Air Lines (DAL.N) said it would resume flying several major routes in June. The NYSE Arca index .XAL gained 14.14%, with Delta up 13.91%.   The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 911.95 points, or 3.85%, to 24,597.37, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 90.21 points, or 3.15%, to 2,953.91 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 220.27 points, or 2.44%, to 9,234.83.  The benchmark S&P 500 notched its biggest one-day percentage gain since April 8, with all 11 major S&P sectors higher.  Markets also took heart from comments by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell over the weekend forecasting a gradual economic recovery and his affirmation that more monetary stimulus would be on the way if required. Powell is set to speak before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday to discuss how economic rescue efforts are working.  Cyclical plays were in favor with the energy .SPNY and industrial .SPLRCI sectors climbing as a gradual recovery in economic activity pointed to more demand for oil and manufactured products.  Still, stocks that are poised to benefit the most from a restart of the economy continue to lag those whose businesses have weathered the restrictions or even grown as a result of the lockdowns. The S&P 500 growth index .IGX has outperformed the S&P value index .IVX by about 4 percentage points this month.       General Motors Co (GM.N) and Ford Motor Co (F.N) both surged, closing up 9.63% and 8.37%, respectively, as the two automakers started to reopen their North American factories in a push to restart work in an industry that accounts for about 6% of U.S. economic activity and employs nearly 1 million people in the United States.  Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 7.12-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 4.43-to-1 ratio favored advancers.  The S&P 500 posted 22 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 88 new highs and seven new lows.   Volume on U.S. exchanges was 12.63 billion shares, compared to the 11.4 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

The scandal rocked Australia\u2019s second-biggest bank after it was accused of millions of breaches of anti-money laundering laws, including allegations that it enabled illegal payments between known child sex offenders.  Les Vance, the current chief operating officer of Westpac\u2019s consumer division, has been with the lender since 2008.   Earlier this month, Westpac admitted it breached anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism laws but denied that it enabled those illegal payments, according to a filing with a federal court.  Chief Executive Officer Peter King said \u201cWestpac has made significant progress in improving its financial crime capability.\u201d adding that Vance will bring a \u201cforensic approach\u201d to the job.  The lender has set aside A$900 million ($586.53 million) for an expected fine in the case, but some analysts expect the fine to be around A$1 billion.  Westpac also said David Lindberg, chief executive of the consumer division, and Chief Information Officer Craig Bright were leaving the bank to take up new roles outside Australia.

John Paul was in 1978 elected he first non-Italian pope in 455 years, becoming Poland\u2019s most famous son in modern times.  He reigned for nearly 27 years and Poles looked to him for guidance during communism and in the years following the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. He died in 2005 and was declared a saint in 2014.  \u201cJohn Paul II changed world\u2019s history. Thanks to him, thanks to Solidarity, communism collapsed and we were able to build a free Poland,\u201d Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said, referring to the free trade union.  Most historians concur that the changes would not have come as quickly without the pope\u2019s backing for Solidarity.  On Monday Pope Francis honoured his predecessor by saying Mass at John Paul\u2019s crypt in St. Peter\u2019s Basilica and the Angelicum, the Rome university where the future pope studied as a young priest, opened a culture institute named after him.   In Krakow, the city where he was bishop, archbishop and cardinal for 20 years, dozens of people prayed, lit candles and left flowers below the window of the residence from where he addressed crowds during his return trips as pope.  \u201cWhen I was a small girl I attended a papal Mass. I feel a bond with him,\u201d said Karolina Malik, 40.  But critics said his legacy was cloudy.  They have said it was still not clear how much John Paul knew about Marcial Maciel, accused of being one of the Church\u2019s worst paedophiles. He abused even the children he had fathered secretly while living a double life and being feted by the Vatican and Church conservatives, according to a report from the Legionaries of Christ Catholic religious order.  \u201cJohn Paul ignored and dismissed reports of sexual abuse by clergy. He defended some of the most notorious predators of the abuse crisis, including Maciel,\u201d Anne Barrett Doyle of the U.S.-based abuse tracker BishopAccountability.org, said on Monday.  Although allegations against the founder of the Legionaries of Christ religious order surfaced as early as 1954, the Vatican only began slowly acknowledging Maciel\u2019s abuse in 2006, when Pope Benedict ordered him to retire to a life of \u201cprayer and penitence\u201d. Maciel died in 2008.  Former Legionaries say Maciel gave huge contributions to the Vatican during the papacy of John Paul, who admired the Legionaries\u2019 orthodoxy and ability to produce vocations.   The official who was in charge of John Paul\u2019s sainthood cause, Polish Monsignor Slawomir Oder, told reporters on Friday that the commission that investigated his life found no evidence that he neglected or covered up abuse scandals.  In Krakow, Natalia Zembrzycka, 52, said she just wanted to pray.   \u201cAs far as paedophilia is concerned - John Paul II did so many good things for so many people and for the Church, that we want to remember him this way, and we don\u2019t want to reflect on these dirty issues,\u201d she said.

With Mexico\u2019s coronavirus death toll having surged past 5,000, and known cases set to surpass 50,000, officials are wrestling with how to restart key industries without triggering greater spread of the virus in the population.  The moves to loosen restrictions follow growing pressure from the United States to reopen factories that are vital to manufacturing supply chains of U.S.-based businesses, especially in the vast automotive sector.  Mexico\u2019s reopening plans have drawn criticism from some politicians worried that the still-rising pandemic tide in Latin America makes it unsafe to send more people to work.  Mexico\u2019s guidelines, published in a document overnight, require companies to submit to authorities health protocols for exiting the coronavirus lockdown. Firms will then be told within 72 hours if they can resume operations.  General Motors Co (GM.N), which operates one of its most important plants in central Mexico, told workers at the weekend to prepare to return there to work on Wednesday. GM also told Mexican suppliers the company expected to comply quickly with the new regulations.  In the United States itself, the auto industry slowly returned to life on Monday, with some vehicle assembly plants reopening after the coronavirus lockdown while suppliers geared up to support a sector that accounts for about 6% of U.S. economic activity.  Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who has said the reopening depends on the advice of health experts, said companies would have to answer an extensive questionnaire as part of efforts to protect workers.  \u201cToday they can start doing the paperwork so that companies in the construction, transport, and mining industries can start their activities, beginning with their health protocols,\u201d Lopez Obrador said in his morning daily conference.  The government said the guidelines will lead to a gradual reopening that follows a so-called traffic light system put in place by authorities.   Municipalities in the country with no coronavirus cases and bordering other municipalities with no cases could also presumably start lifting the lockdown on Monday.  On May 12, Mexico reported a record number of deaths in a single day with 353 fatalities. That grim news was followed on Friday by a reported 2,437 new coronavirus infections, a one-day record rise in cases since the start of the pandemic.  Critics, including some within Lopez Obrador\u2019s own ruling MORENA party, worry that restarting factories too soon could exacerbate the spread the of the virus before it has been brought under control.

Trump announced the planned removal of Linick in a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi late on Friday. He was the fourth government inspector general that the Republican president has ousted in recent weeks.  Pompeo told the Washington Post he had asked Trump to fire Linick, while declining to describe specific concerns. Pompeo said no reason had to be given, contradicting Congress\u2019 interpretation of the inspector general law.  \u201cI went to the president and made clear to him that Inspector General Linick wasn\u2019t performing a function in a way that we had tried to get him to, that was additive for the State Department,\u201d Pompeo said.  Another State official told the Post concern over Linick had grown because of leaks about investigations, although there was no evidence Linick was responsible.  Representative Eliot Engel, chairman of the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee, and Senator Bob Menendez, ranking member on Senate Foreign Relations, said Linick had been investigating Trump\u2019s declaration of a national emergency last year to clear the way for $8 billion in military sales, mostly to Saudi Arabia.  Engel and Menendez announced on Saturday they were launching an investigation of Linick\u2019s firing.  \u201cI have learned that there may be another reason for Mr. Linick\u2019s firing. His office was investigating - at my request - Trump\u2019s phony declaration of an emergency so he could send weapons to Saudi Arabia,\u201d Engel said in a statement.  Engel called on the administration to comply with the probe and turn over records by Friday.  Engel\u2019s statement was first reported by the Washington Post.  Congressional aides had said Linick was investigating whether Pompeo misused a taxpayer-funded political appointee to perform personal tasks for himself and his wife.  Trump said Linick had been appointed by former Democratic President Barack Obama, and that he knew nothing about him, but had the right to terminate him. \u201cI just go rid of him,\u201d he said.  Trump infuriated many members of Congress last May, including some Republicans, by declaring a national emergency related to tensions with Iran to sidestep congressional review and push ahead with $8 billion in military sales, mostly to Saudi Arabia.  The House and Senate passed resolutions to block the sales. But Trump, a staunch promoter of both arms sales and ties to Saudi Arabia, vetoed them. The Republican-led Senate upheld his veto.  Menendez said he believed Linick was close to coming to a conclusion in his investigation of the arms sales. He also introduced legislation to protect inspectors general.  Some Republicans also expressed concern.   Senator Chuck Grassley wrote to Trump and asked for a detailed explanation of Linick\u2019s removal by June 1.  \u201cCongress\u2019s intent is clear that an expression of lost confidence, without further explanation, is not sufficient to fulfill the requirements of the IG Reform Act,\u201d Grassley said.  Representative Michael McCaul, top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs committee, was looking into the matter, a spokeswoman said.  Trump replaced Linick with Stephen Akard, an official in charge of the Office of Foreign Missions considered a close ally of Vice President Mike Pence.  Explaining Linick\u2019s firing to Pelosi, Trump said only that he no longer had \u201cfullest confidence\u201d in Linick.  Pelosi wrote to Trump and asked him to provide \u201cdetailed and substantial justification\u201d for Linick\u2019s removal within 30 days.

The decision taken at a cabinet meeting exempts pharmacies, food supply stores and food deliveries. Malls and dine-in restaurants were already closed but other stores had still been operating.  The country of some 2.8 million on Monday reported 1,364 new COVID-19 cases, raising the total to 33,969, the second highest infection count after larger neighbour Saudi Arabia among six Gulf Arab states. Its death toll from the virus stands at 15.  Qatar, where expatriates make up the majority of the population, has like other Gulf states seen the virus spread among low-wage foreign workers living in cramped quarters.  Other measures approved by the cabinet include requiring all citizens and residents to install a mobile app designed to track COVID-19 cases starting May 22, state news agency QNA reported.  No more than two people can be in a car and up to three in a chauffeured vehicle, while buses must operate at half capacity. People can exercise in public near their residence if they practice physical distancing and wear face masks, QNA said.

Mayer led the successful launch of the Disney+ streaming service in November but in February was passed over for the chief executive job at Disney.   TikTok, which allows users to create short videos with special effects, is rising in popularity among teenagers and has become a cultural trendsetter.   The Chinese ownership of ByteDance, however, has sparked concerns in Washington.   In November, the U.S. government launched a national security review of ByteDance\u2019s $1 billion acquisition of social media app Musical.ly. Two senators have also introduced a bill to ban federal employees from using TikTok on government-issued phones.  To appease those concerns, ByteDance has stepped up efforts to separate TikTok from much of its Chinese businesses and has made several high-profile executive hires in recent months.  Under Mayer\u2019s leadership, Disney+ signed up more than 50 million subscribers in five months.  Disney named Rebecca Campbell, a 23-year company veteran, to replace Mayer as head of the direct-to-consumer and international division. That includes the streaming media units that Disney is counting on to drive future growth while cable television viewership declines.

The data comes from eight people who took part in a 45-subject safety trial that kicked off in March. The Moderna vaccine is one of more than 100 under development intended to protect against the novel coronavirus that has infected more than 4.7 million people globally and killed over 317,000.  Overall, the study showed the vaccine was safe and all study participants produced antibodies against the virus.  An analysis of the response in the eight individuals showed that those who received a 100 microgram dose and people who received a 25 microgram dose had levels of protective antibodies to fend of the virus that exceeded those found in the blood of people who recovered from COVID-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus.  The news, issued in a release by the U.S. biotechnology company, lifted shares of Moderna by 20%. The stock later fell 1.6% in extended trading after the company said it plans to sell $1.25 billion in common stock to raise money for vaccine development and manufacturing.   \u201cThese are significant findings but it is a Phase 1 clinical trial that only included eight people. It was designed for safety, not for efficacy,\u201d said  Dr. Amesh Adalja, in infectious disease expert at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security who was not involved in the study.  The very early data offers a glimmer of hope for a vaccine among the most advanced in development.  Adalja said many glitches can occur between now and the time this vaccine is tested for efficacy in thousands of people. \u201cWhat we do see is encouraging,\u201d he said.   Scientists are trying to understand what level of antibodies will ultimately prove protective against the novel coronavirus, and how long that protection will last.  Moderna said the vaccine appeared to show a dose response, meaning that people who the 100 mcg dose produced more antibodies than people who got the lower dose.   The vaccine has gotten the green light to start the second stage of human testing. Last week, U.S. regulators gave the vaccine \u201cfast-track\u201d status to speed up the regulatory review.  In the Phase II, or midstage, trial designed to further test effectiveness and find the optimal dose, Moderna said it will drop plans to test a 250 mcg dose and test a 50 mcg dose instead.  Reducing the dose required to produce immunity could help spare the amount of vaccine required in each shot, meaning the company could ultimately produce more of the vaccine.  \u201cIn the context of a pandemic, we expect demand to far outstrip supply and the lower the dose the more people we expect to be able to protect,\u201d said Chief Medical Officer Tal Zaks.  The U.S. government in April placed a big bet on Moderna, backing its vaccine with $483 million from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).  The company said that grant will enable it to supply millions of doses per month in 2020 and, with further investments, tens of millions a month in 2021 if the vaccine proves successful.  \u201cWe are investing to scale up manufacturing so we can maximize the number of doses we can produce to help protect as many people as we can from SARS-CoV-2,\u201d Moderna Chief Executive  St\u00e9phane Bancel said, using the official name for the new virus.  In May, Moderna struck a 10-year strategic collaboration with Lonza Group (LONN.S) that over time will allow the company to make up to 1 billion 50 mcg doses by the end of 2021, Zaks said in an interview.  The company is working out a plan to provide vaccine to countries outside of the United States, Zaks said.  \u201cThe U.S. is poised to be the first beneficiary of this vaccine,\u201d Zaks said, adding that the company believes it has an \u201cethical obligation to make this vaccine available to whoever needs it globally.\u201d  Moderna said it expects to start a larger late-stage, or Phase III, trial in July.  There are currently no approved treatments or vaccines for COVID-19, and experts predict a safe and effective vaccine could take 12 to 18 months from the start of development, which in Moderna\u2019s case was in January.  The most notable side effects reported from the early testing of Moderna\u2019s vaccine were three participants with \u201cflu-like\u201d symptoms following a second shot of the highest dose.

Reporting by Nelson Renteria, Writing by Daina Beth Solomon","10":"(Reuters) - Uber Technologies Inc (UBER.N) will concentrate on its core businesses in ride-hailing and food delivery and cut 23% of its workforce in an attempt to become profitable despite the coronavirus pandemic, Chief Executive Officer Dara Khosrowshahi said in an email to employees on Monday.  Uber will cut a total of 6,700 jobs, including the 3,700 it had announced earlier this month, Khosrowshahi said, adding that the company plans to reduce investments in several \u201cnon-core projects.\u201d  Shares in Uber were up 6.9% to $34.69 following the announcement.  In a regulatory filing on Monday, Uber said the layoffs and restructuring measures will result in one-time, mostly cash-based charges of between $210 million and $260 million in the second quarter. Overall, the measures are expected to generate $1 billion in annual cost savings compared with pre-pandemic budget plans.   Uber employed 28,600 people before the pandemic crippled its business, according to a regulatory filing at the end of the first quarter. The company\u2019s initial wave of 3,700 layoffs affected less-costly customer support and recruiting teams, while Monday\u2019s announcement affects 3,000 employees across nearly all departments.  Smaller U.S. rival Lyft Inc (LYFT.O) said late last month it would cut about 17% of its workforce.  Khosrowshahi said Uber must establish itself as a self-sustaining enterprise no longer in need of outside capital, calling the company\u2019s food delivery business Uber Eats the \u201cnext enormous growth opportunity.\u201d  Before the pandemic struck, Uber said it would become profitable on the basis of adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization by the end of this year. The company withdrew that guidance as global stay-at-home orders to curb the virus pummeled its ride-hailing business.  Ride-hailing trips, which generate the bulk of Uber\u2019s revenue, dropped 80% globally in April, but the company said demand was slowly recovering.  Uber on May 7 said it was now aiming to become profitable on an adjusted basis at some point in 2021, partially thanks to an uptick in restaurant food order deliveries.  Khosrowshahi on Monday called Uber Eats a silver lining during the crisis and said be believes the currently loss-making unit would one day be profitable.  Demand for Uber Eats jumped 50% in the first quarter, but the unit still lost $313 million on an adjusted EBITDA basis.  Uber is currently in talks to buy food delivery rival GrubHub Inc (GRUB.N) to expand its market share.       Uber has been working on various other businesses, including the development of self-driving cars and a freight logistics network. Khosrowshahi did not directly mention these businesses in his email and a spokesman declined to comment beyond the email.  His email said Uber would close its startup incubator program and artificial intelligence research lab. Uber was also looking at strategic alternatives for Uber Works, a platform Uber launched in October to help companies fill staffing gaps  with temporary workers during peak demand.  Khosrowshahi also said the company was closing or consolidating some 45 office locations globally as part of the restructuring.

Madrid last week surprised its European Union partners by  imposing a two-week quarantine on all overseas travellers and effectively keeping its borders closed, saying it wanted to avoid a second wave of COVID-19.  But the move was meant to be temporary and Transport Minister Jose Luis Abalos said it would be phased out in parallel with travel being allowed within Spain.  \u201cWe can\u2019t allow foreigners to travel while the Spanish population is confined,\u201d he told broadcaster TVE. \u201cFrom late June, we\u2019ll start tourism activity, I hope ... We must make Spain an attractive country from the health point of view.\u201d  Tourism accounts for over 12% of Spain\u2019s economic output. Even with borders reopening in late June, the industry\u2019s revenues will fall by 93 to 124 billion euros ($100 to $134 billion), lobby group Exceltur estimates.  Spain registered 59 deaths overnight from the coronavirus, the second day the number has been below 100 and the lowest in two months, the health ministry said.   The cumulative death toll rose to 27,709, while cases rose to 231,606 on Monday from 231,350 the previous day.   \u201cToday\u2019s data are really good compared to what we\u2019ve seen so far,\u201d Health Emergency Chief Fernando Simon told reporters.  Simon said the mortality rate had decreased from around 11% during the late March peak in Spain to less than 2% for those who developed symptoms between April 27 and May 3.   Encouraged by the statistics, Spain is slowly easing a strict lockdown in place since mid-March that even stopped people from going outside for exercise.  The Health Ministry said on Monday it would expand the use of face masks, currently obligatory on public transport. People must now wear masks in closed spaces and in public if it is not possible to guarantee the minimum safe distance of two metres.   Restaurants and bars were gradually reopening - even though staff knew customers would be scarce.  In the Mediterranean city of Valencia, restaurant manager Cristina Gonzalo and her staff were out early preparing their beachside bar. Dressed in a white shirt and matching mask, a waiter painstakingly measured out space between tables to  comply with social-distancing requirements.  Gonzalo said she had doubts about reopening but was happy to  help staff, who had been furloughed under the government\u2019s temporary layoff program.  \u201cThey did not receive money to shop for essentials and they were desperate,\u201d she said.  But in a sign many outlets may not survive, football superfan Manolo Caceres - famed for banging a big drum in support of Spain at 10 World Cups - told Reuters he was facing bankruptcy after being forced to close his Valencia bar.  \u201cI\u2019ve lost everything,\u201d said Caceres, 71, known affectionately as \u201cManolo el del Bombo\u201d (Manolo with the drum).  \u201cI want to sell my World Cup drum because I don\u2019t have enough money to eat,\u201d he added, explaining his 800 euro monthly pension barely covered his mortgage.        The epidemic has put health services under severe stress and battered the economy, which could shrink between 9.5-12.4% this year, followed by a 6.1-8.5% bounce back in 2021, Bank of Spain governor Pablo Hernandez de Cos said.

Siding with hundreds of people hurt and relatives of people killed in the bombings, the justices ruled 8-0 to throw out a lower court\u2019s 2017 decision that had freed Sudan from punitive damages awarded in the litigation in addition to about $6 billion in compensatory damages. Justice Brett Kavanaugh did not participate in the case.   The ruling reinstates about $826 million out of a total $4.3 billion in punitive damages, said Christopher Curran, a lawyer representing Sudan.   The case hinged on the Supreme Court\u2019s view of a 2008 amendment to a federal law known as the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act allowing for punitive damages. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in 2017 upheld Sudan\u2019s liability but ruled that the amendment was made after the bombings occurred and could not be applied retroactively.  Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote in Monday\u2019s ruling that for claims made under federal law, \u201cCongress was as clear as it could have been when it authorized plaintiffs to seek and win punitive damages for past conduct.\u201d   The remainder of the punitive damages will be subject to further litigation as the ruling ordered the D.C. Circuit to reconsider its decision that the foreign plaintiffs who sued Sudan under state law in the United States also could not seek punitive damages.   \u201cAs always, Sudan expresses sympathy for the victims of the acts of terrorism at issue, but reaffirms that it was not involved in any wrongdoing in connection with those acts,\u201d Curran said.   Starting in 2001, groups of plaintiffs sued in federal court in Washington under the 1976 Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, which generally bars claims against foreign countries except those designated by the United States as state sponsors of terrorism - as Sudan has been since 1993.   \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine an act more deserving of punitive damages, and we are deeply gratified that the Supreme Court has validated our clients\u2019 right to receive this measure of compensation,\u201d said Matthew McGill, a lawyer for the plaintiffs.   Twelve Americans were killed by the Aug. 7, 1998, truck bombs that detonated outside the embassies in Nairobi, Kenya and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. The lawsuits involve 567 people, mostly non-U.S. citizens who were employees of the U.S. government and their relatives.

NIBC said in April it would delay payment of its 0.53 euro ($0.5785) 2019 final dividend amid the coronavirus outbreak, following guidance from the Dutch Central Bank. That prompted Blackstone to warn that the special purpose company it had set up for the intended offer for NIBC might not have sufficient funding to complete the acquisition. Blackstone also said regulatory hang-ups could jeopardize the deal.  \u201cAfter further discussions NIBC has now committed to ... pay the dividend before settlement, in order to enable the offeror to pay for the offer at 9.32 euros per share,\u201d the bank said in an after-hours statement.  NIBC shares closed at 6.48 euros on Monday.  Blackstone is due to submit its request to review the proposed deal to Dutch regulators by Tuesday.  U.S. private equity firm JC Flowers, which holds 60.6% of NIBC\u2019s stock, and Dutch investment firm Reggeborgh, which owns 14.6%, have agreed to Blackstone\u2019s proposed offer.  NIBC said on Monday that as part of the deal JC Flowers and Reggeborgh would waive their right to the 2019 dividend \u201cuntil such time that in the opinion of the management and supervisory boards of NIBC, payment is feasible and appropriate in light of the impact of COVID-19 on the business.\u201d  NIBC, which services around 600 small firms and 400,000 retail clients in the Netherlands, made a net profit of 194 million euros last year.

But the WHO\u2019s chief critic, the U.S. administration of President Donald Trump, decried an \u201capparent attempt to conceal this outbreak by at least one member state\u201d.  Trump said later in Washington that the WHO, which he called a \u201cpuppet of China\u201d, had \u201cdone a very sad job\u201d in its handling of the coronavirus and he would make a decision about U.S. funding to the body soon.  \u201cThe United States pays them $450 million a year; China pays them $38 million a year. And they\u2019re a puppet of China. They\u2019re China-centric, to put it nicer, but they\u2019re a puppet of China,\u201d Trump told reporters at a White House event.  Trump has already suspended U.S. funding for the WHO after accusing it of being too China-centric, and at the same time led international criticism of Beijing\u2019s perceived lack of transparency in the early stages of the crisis.  Health Secretary Alex Azar did not mention China by name, but made clear Washington considered the WHO jointly responsible.  \u201cWe must be frank about one of the primary reasons this outbreak spun out of control,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was a failure by this organization to obtain the information that the world needed, and that failure cost many lives.\u201d   Speaking after Azar, Chinese Health Minister Ma Xiaowei said Beijing had been timely and open in announcing the outbreak and sharing the virus\u2019s full gene sequence, and urged countries to \u201coppose rumours, stigmatisation and discrimination\u201d.  Chinese President Xi Jinping pledged $2 billion over the next two years to help deal with COVID-19, especially in developing countries.  The amount almost matches the WHO\u2019s entire annual programme budget for last year, and more than compensates for Trump\u2019s freeze of U.S. payments worth about $400 million a year.  But White House National Security Council spokesman John Ullyot called it \u201ca token to distract from calls from a growing number of nations demanding accountability for the Chinese government\u2019s failure to ... warn the world of what was coming\u201d.    WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the U.N. body had \u201csounded the alarm early, and we sounded it often\u201d.  When it declared a global emergency on Jan. 30, there were fewer than 100 cases outside China, and no deaths, he said.  He was addressing a virtual meeting of the WHO\u2019s decision-making body, the World Health Assembly, at which Xi said China had acted with \u201copenness and transparency and responsibility\u201d.  Tedros, who has always promised a review, told the forum it would come \u201cat the earliest appropriate moment\u201d and make recommendations for the future. He received robust backing from the WHO\u2019s independent oversight panel.   \u201cEvery country and every organisation must examine its response and learn from its experience,\u201d he said, adding that the review must cover \u201call actors in good faith\u201d.  In its first report on the handling of the pandemic, the oversight committee said the WHO had \u201cdemonstrated leadership and made important progress in its COVID-19 response\u201d.  The panel endorsed a review but said conducting it now could hamper the WHO\u2019s response to the pandemic.  It also said \u201can imperfect and evolving understanding\u201d was not unusual when a new disease emerged and, in an apparent rejoinder to Trump, said a \u201crising politicization of pandemic response\u201d was hindering the effort to defeat the virus.  Azar said the United States supported \u201can independent review of every aspect of WHO\u2019s response\u201d and that China\u2019s conduct should be \u201con the table\u201d too.  A resolution drafted by the European Union calling for an independent evaluation of the WHO\u2019s performance appeared to have won consensus backing among the WHO\u2019s 194 states. It was expected to be debated and adopted on Tuesday.  German Health Minister Jens Spahn said the WHO must become \u201cmore independent from external interference\u201d and that its role in \u201cleading and coordination\u201d must be strengthened.  China has previously opposed calls for a review of the origin and spread of the coronavirus, but Xi signalled that Beijing would accept an impartial evaluation of the global response, once the pandemic is brought under control.  \u201cThis work needs a scientific and professional attitude, and needs to be led by the WHO,\u201d he told the meeting via video.  The WHO and most experts say the virus is likely to have emerged in a market selling wildlife in the central city of Wuhan late last year. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said this month there was \u201csignificant\u201d evidence that it had come from a laboratory in Wuhan, a charge China rejects.  Australian health minister Gregory Hunt said the planned review could look at strengthening the WHO\u2019s mandate and powers of inspection, and also how to protect against \u201cthe global threat posed by wildlife and wet markets\u201d.

In doing so, Biden would reverse actions taken by President Donald Trump, who in 2017 cleared the way for the $8 billion oil sands pipeline to built across the U.S.-Canada border.   Trump, a Republican, had made building the pipeline a central promise of his presidential campaign. Biden was vice president in the Obama administration when it rejected the project as contrary to its efforts to combat climate change.   \u201cBiden strongly opposed the Keystone pipeline in the last administration, stood alongside President Obama and Secretary Kerry to reject it in 2015, and will proudly stand in the Roosevelt Room again as President and stop it for good by rescinding the Keystone XL pipeline permit,\u201d Stef Feldman, Biden\u2019s policy director, said in a statement.   Construction of the pipeline, which would carry 830,000 barrels a day of crude from Alberta, Canada to the U.S. Midwest, has been delayed for more than decade by opposition from landowners, environmental groups and tribes.   Last month, a U.S. federal court dealt another setback when it ruled against the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers\u2019 use of a new pipeline permit to cross bodies of water, potentially delaying construction further.

Rubio, 48, has been an active Republican voice on national security and foreign policy matters throughout the nine years he has been in the Senate.  He is known as a hawk on dealings with China, Russia and Cuba, the country from which his parents came to Florida as immigrants.  The appointment makes Rubio part of the so-called Gang of Eight, the leaders of Congress and the Senate and House of Representatives intelligence committees who receive the most sensitive classified briefings.  Rubio sought the Republican presidential nomination in 2016, eventually losing the primary race to real estate developer Donald Trump, who defeated former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in that November\u2019s general election.  Rubio is also chairman of the Senate Small Business Committee, which has played an important role in efforts to help the U.S. economy recover from the ravages of the coronavirus pandemic.  McConnell did not say whether Rubio would step aside as leader of that panel. Aides to Rubio did not immediately respond to requests for comment.   Burr told McConnell on May 14 that he would temporarily leave his position as chairman of the powerful intelligence committee. U.S. officials said then that the FBI had seized his mobile telephone in major escalation of a probe of his stock trades before the market downtown caused by the coronavirus pandemic.

Baidu\u2019s U.S.-listed shares jumped 8% in extended trading after the company also reported a smaller-than-expected drop in first-quarter revenue and easily beat profit estimates.  China\u2019s stalled economy is starting up much earlier than Europe and the United States, which are easing restrictions gradually as they struggle with high reported infections and deaths from COVID-19, a disease caused by the novel coronavirus.  Baidu forecast current-quarter revenue between 25.0 billion yuan and 27.3 billion yuan, while analysts on average had expected 25.55 billion yuan.   The company said daily active users for Baidu App surged 28% in March to hit the 222 million mark.  \u201cThis performance is encouraging, as it shows that the worst stretch is likely over for Chinese internet companies as the economy slowly gets back to its feet and the digital ad market revives,\u201d said Haris Anwar, senior analyst at financial markets platform Investing.com.  Revenue from Baidu\u2019s online marketing services business, which includes search, news feeds and video apps and is a major contributor to overall sales, tumbled 19% to 14.24 billion yuan in the first quarter ended March 31.  Total revenue declined about 7% to 22.55 billion yuan ($3.17 billion), but beat estimate of 21.93 billion yuan.  Baidu in February estimated revenue between 21 billion yuan and 22.9 billion yuan.

A group of protesters threw rocks, shouted and burned piles of wood along a street in the destitute neighborhood on Santiago\u2019s southern fringe. Images on social media and local television showed police spraying tear gas and water cannons to disperse the growing crowd.   The municipality said in a statement that families were going hungry in the poorest sectors of El Bosque, a neighborhood where many work informally, or not at all. The city district has been under quarantine since mid-April, city officials said in a statement.  \u201cThe last weeks we have had a great demand from neighbors for food,\u201d El Bosque Mayor Sadi Melo, of Chile\u00b4s opposition Socialist party, told Radio BioBio. \u201cWe are in a very complex situation of hunger and lack of work.\u201d  Santiago is one of Latin America\u00b4s most prosperous cities. But a stark rich-poor divide and a growing sense of inequality prompted mass protests in late 2019. Many of the demands lodged by protesters last year, from increased pensions to higher pay, remain unresolved.  In a statement, Melo\u00b4s office said El Bosque had distributed more than 2,000 aid packages to the neediest families. But it warned the central government \u201cnot to continue to burden municipalities with an economic responsibility we cannot cover.\u201d  Chile\u00b4s center-right president, Sebastian Pinera, said in a televised address later on Monday that his government would deliver 2.5 million baskets of food and cleaning supplies directly to homes by late this week or early next.  \u201cWe will prioritize the most vulnerable families,\u201d Pinera said, calling the planned delivery of food \u201chistoric.\u201d   The South American nation has already announced a massive stimulus package worth nearly 7% of gross domestic product to ease the economic impact of the pandemic, although opposition leaders and social groups have criticized the package as inadequate.   The government\u00b4s proposed measures include beefed-up  unemployment checks, deferred tax payments and government-backed credit lines for small business.

Separately, the country, which had suspended entry of non-Emirati residents on March 19, said it would next month start receiving those with valid residencies stranded abroad whose families are in the UAE, state media reported.  The nationwide curfew, which currently runs from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., would start at 8 p.m. on Wednesday until further notice, Saif Al Dhaheri, spokesman for the National Emergency Crisis and Disaster Management Authority, told a news conference.  The UAE on Monday reported 832 infections and four deaths from the virus to take its count to 24,190 with 224 deaths.  The country halted regular passenger flights and closed most public venues to combat the disease but like other Gulf Arab states saw the virus spread among low-income migrant workers living in overcrowded quarters, leading to an increase in testing.   Authorities have arranged repatriation flights for citizens and a limited number of residents and to evacuate foreigners.  The state news agency said residents with relatives in the UAE could start returning as of June 1 to reunite with family.  Some emirates, including business and tourism hub Dubai, allowed malls to reopen at limited capacity during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan that began on April 24. Dubai has also allowed dine-in restaurants and cafes to resume business at 30% capacity and public parks to reopen with restrictions.  Dhaheri urged those celebrating the Eid al-Fitr holiday that marks the end of Ramadan to avoid family gatherings. He said malls could operate from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. during Eid with shoppers allowed to be there for a maximum of two hours.  Another official detailed an updated list of penalties for violation of containment measures, including a fine of 50,000 dirhams ($13,000) for not heeding quarantine orders and 3,000 dirhams for not wearing a face mask or practicing physical distancing in public, or breaking curfew.   The official said the public prosecutor would impose penalties of up to six months in prison or a fine of no less than 100,000 dirhams for repeat offenders.

Boeing has appointed former engineering and development chief Mike Delaney to head wider efforts to build  confidence, and Airbus leaders say the industry is moving from an initial crisis phase to securing public trust.  That has triggered, among other things, a concerted effort to explain how cabin air filtration works in a bid to scotch the myth that the pressurised fuselage contains only static or recycled air.  Health officials are still quantifying various sources of transmission for COVID-19 disease caused by the virus, but attention focuses on the risk of catching it from airborne droplets from coughing or sneezing passengers as well as from  touching infected surfaces.  The air-travel industry historically talks more about seat pitch than air quality. That\u2019s had to change as a result of the pandemic.   \u201cIt\u2019s about explaining what we do for the safety of passengers in the large sense: aircraft safety but also sanitary safety,\u201d Airbus engineering head Jean-Brice Dumont said.  In an office building, air is exchanged about four times every hour. On a modern jet aircraft, that rises to 20 to 30 times.  \u201cThe air system on an airplane is as good as anything you will be exposed to,\u201d Delaney said. Air circulation is only one of several techniques for reducing potential for the virus to spread on board including rigorous cleaning of the plane and screening passengers for signs of illness, he added.  In most cases compressed air is fed from the clean part of an engine - untainted by fuel which is added later - to air conditioning packs and from there to fans in the cabin ceiling.  Both planemakers say cabin air pours downwards not lengthways through the fuselage, reducing risks of infection.      Half that air is then recycled through hospital-grade HEPA filters designed to remove some 99.97% of contaminants including viruses. The other half is flushed outside through valves.  Planemakers say cabin air is renewed every two to three minutes, though scientists caution that in reality, air is always a blend. But the quicker the rate, the faster old air is diluted.  \u201cThe air turns over very, very quickly in the aircraft in terms of air-exchange rate. From that point of view the aircraft systems are very good,\u201d said Professor Byron Jones of Kansas State University, who has helped recommend air standards.  But air flow isn\u2019t the only part of a complex equation.  \u201cThe biggest challenge you have on an aircraft is the extremely high occupant density. You have got a lot of people crammed into a small space, and you have to get a lot of air in there to ventilate that space to maintain the air quality,\u201d Jones said.  The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say the virus is thought to spread between people in close contact or   less than 6 feet apart, around half the width of many cabins.   Air currents over such short distances are said to be hardest to predict. Passengers have some control through the individual air outlets nicknamed \u201cgaspers\u201d above each seat.   On average, twisting them on makes things \u201ca little bit better, but there is no guarantee,\u201d Jones said.   Although filtered, the pinpoint blasts of air could in a worst case push nearby virus particles across a passenger\u2019s face. On the other hand, the air shower could have the positive effect of limiting sideways movements of air.  Faced with such questions, Boeing and Airbus have deployed  engineers to examine seat-to-seat air flows - using the same advanced physics at play in wind-tunnel testing of a wing.  \u201cWe are actively running simulations to see whether we could recommend something for the individual air jets, \u201c Dumont said.  The spectre of in-flight contamination dates back at least to the SARS epidemic in 2003, though no link has been proved.  In March that year, a 72-year-old man infected with SARS, which is also a coronavirus, took a flight from Hong Kong to Beijing. At least 22 of the 119 passengers and two crew later developed the illness.  It was the only significant case of in-flight transmission but prompted measures to prevent ill passengers boarding planes.   Such \u201ckerb-to-kerb\u201d measures must again be part of the strategy to keep the new virus off planes, Delaney said. Research on technology like ultraviolet-cleaning systems and anti-microbial materials may join the fight in the future.

Global airlines have suffered an unprecedented decline in travel due to the pandemic, though some recent indicators show that U.S. demand may have hit a low.  The U.S. Transportation Security Administration (TSA) screened 250,467 travelers on Friday, the first time the number has surpassed 250,000 since March 24, according to daily data on its website.  While that is far below the 2.66 million passengers screened on the same day last year, it is significantly more than the mid-April low of 87,534.  Delta is adding roughly 100 more daily flights in June versus May, including service out of its Atlanta hub and New York\u2019s John F. Kennedy International Airport to Florida, even as its overall second-quarter schedule is expected to be 85% smaller than last year.

The two biggest EU countries, whose agreements usually pave the way for broader EU deals, proposed that the European Commission borrow the money on behalf of the whole EU and spend it as an additional top-up to the 2021-2027 EU budget that is already close to 1 trillion euros over that period.  \u201cThat\u2019s a real change in philosophy,\u201d French President Emmanuel Macron said. \u201cI believe this is a very deep transformation and that\u2019s what the European Union and the single market needed to remain coherent. It\u2019s what the euro zone needs to remain united.\u201d  The proposal moves the EU more in the direction of a transfer union and is likely to please countries like Italy or Spain which have long called for more joint action in response to the crisis.  But offering grants rather than loans could be hard to swallow for some of the frugal northern countries of the 27-nation bloc, like the Netherlands, Finland and Austria.  \u201cOur position remains unchanged. We are ready to help most affected countries with loans,\u201d Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said on Twitter. \u201cWe expect the updated (EU budget) to reflect the new priorities rather than raising the ceiling.\u201d  The euro jumped against the dollar EUR= to 1.0912 from 1.0851 on the news and bond yields in Italy, one of the hardest hit by the pandemic and which has a huge public debt, fell to a one-month low of 1.67% from 1.79% IT10YT=RR.  Still, grants from the Recovery Fund will have strings attached - they are to be \u201cbased on a clear commitment from Member States to follow sound economic policies and an ambitious reform agenda\u201d the document said.  The money is to be spent particularly on investment in the EU\u2019s transition to a more \u201cgreen\u201d and digital economy and boost research and innovation.  It is to be paid for through the EU budget that will come after 2027, the Franco-German document said.  France and Germany did not specify whether that would mean higher national contributions based on the size of each economy or some new taxes that would be earmarked for the EU, or a combination of both.  German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the 500 billion euros should be paid back over a long time and that Berlin would shoulder roughly 27% of the funds, as it already does for the regular EU budget.  \u201cWe must act in a European way so that we get out of the crisis well and strengthened,\u201d Merkel told reporters.  France and Germany had previously struggled to present a united front in the coronavirus crisis as France lead a push by mostly southern countries to get fiscally conservative northerners, including Germany, to issue joint European debt to help them recover from the deepest ever recession, which is now expected to come this year.  Macron said the plan was a result of \u201cclose cooperation\u201d with Italy and the Netherlands - diplomatic language indicating the two countries had been consulted.  \u201cWe will consider proposals and ideas like the French and Germans have done. Eventually there must be a proposal from the European Commission and that will be the starting point for the discussions,\u201d said Stephan Schrover, a spokesman for Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte.  The European Commission is to present its own proposal for a Recovery Fund linked to the EU\u2019s next long-term budget on May 27th and said it welcomed the initiative from Paris and Berlin.  \u201cIt acknowledges the scope and the size of the economic challenge that Europe faces, and rightly puts the emphasis on the need to work on a solution with the European budget at its core,\u201d Commission head Ursula von der Leyen said.  \u201cThis goes in the direction of the proposal the Commission is working on which will also take into account the views of all member States and the European Parliament,\u201d she said.  The European Parliament has called in a resolution for governments to assign new, dedicated revenue streams to the EU budget so that it can pay back the money the Commission would borrow to pay for the grants.  Among possible new revenue sources for the EU budget, which now gets its money from national contributions, a cut of national VAT and customs and sugar levies, the parliament has listed a plastics tax, a digital tax, a financial transactions tax and a levy on goods imported into the EU from countries that have lower CO2 emissions standards than the EU.

Closing in on a deal after two months of often bitter talks, the European Union\u2019s biggest powers proposed a fund on Monday that would offer non-repayable grants to EU regions and sectors hit hardest by the pandemic, with the cash borrowed by the bloc as a whole rather than by individual member states.  Although the plan still requires the consent of all EU members, it would be a big step towards debt mutualisation, once a taboo for German governments fearing that their taxpayers might be liable for the fiscal irresponsibility of others.  \u201cThe Franco-German proposals are ambitious, targeted and, of course, welcome,\u201d Lagarde said in a joint interview with four European newspapers, after announcement of the plan sent the euro higher and reduced Italian bond yields.  \u201cThey pave the way for the European Commission to borrow funds over the long term and, above all, they allow a substantial amount of direct support to be provided to the countries most affected by the crisis,\u201d Lagarde told newspapers Les Echos, Handelsblatt, Corriere della Sera and El Mundo.  Buying 1.1 trillion euros of debt this year, the ECB would be expected to buy any bonds jointly issued by EU members, keeping borrowing costs down and increasing the pool of coveted safe assets.  The euro zone economy is expected to shrink by a tenth this year, and even with many coronavirus restrictions already lifted, the recovery is expected to last well beyond this year.  Reflecting on a recent German Constitutional Court ruling that the ECB exceeded its powers with sovereign bond buys, Lagarde said the German central bank is under obligation to carry out the ECB\u2019s decision.   \u201cAccording to the Treaty, all national central banks should fully participate in the determination and implementation of monetary policy in the euro area,\u201d she said.  Her comments may foreshadow a legal clash as the German court said the Bundesbank must quit the asset buys unless the ECB can prove they are necessary.  If the ECB fails that test, the Bundesbank is likely to face a conflict between its EU Treaty obligation and a ruling by the nation\u2019s highest court.

The complaint is the latest salvo from voting rights activists, who have filed dozens of lawsuits around the country to increase ballot access, such as universal vote-by-mail, in light of the coronavirus pandemic.  Wisconsin was at the center of the battle in April, when a last-minute effort by Democratic Governor Tony Evers to postpone the primary election was stymied after Republican legislative leaders challenged his order in court. With many polling places shut down due to a lack of poll workers, many voters waited in long lines, risking infection.   Monday\u2019s lawsuit, filed in federal court in Madison, the capital, said tens of thousands of voters were disenfranchised after they \u201cencountered obstacles at almost every stage of the election process,\u201d including crowded poll places and thousands of absentee ballots that were either not delivered or arrived too late.  The burdens fell disproportionately on minority, disabled and immuno-compromised voters, according to the lawsuit, which was filed by Disability Rights Wisconsin, Black Leaders Organizing for Communities and three individual Wisconsinites.  A spokesman for the state elections commission, which was named as a defendant, declined to comment on pending litigation.  Also on Monday, the League of Women Voters of New Jersey and other groups sued New Jersey in federal court, arguing that the state\u2019s signature-match requirement for mail-in ballots disenfranchises thousands of voters, particularly immigrants, minorities, the elderly and the disabled.  The two lawsuits join a plethora of others as activists warn that the ongoing coronavirus outbreak could throw November\u2019s election into chaos without immediate steps to make it easier for voters to cast ballots by mail.  Many of the lawsuits are backed by Democrats, who argue they are trying to protect voters\u2019 rights in a public health crisis and that Republican resistance is intended to disenfranchise minority and other voters who tend to vote Democratic. Marc Elias, the attorney leading the party\u2019s efforts, has pending cases in 17 different states  Republicans have argued that loosening restrictions could increase the potential for voter fraud, though examples in the United States are exceedingly rare.

(Reuters) - Businesses in the San Francisco Bay Area may open for curbside retail and manufacturing, while fan-free professional sports events might be allowed as soon as June, as California continued to loosen coronavirus health restrictions on Monday.  California Governor Gavin Newsom said Monday the state has been in discussions with officials of all of the major sports leagues about a possible resumption of play. But rules aimed at protecting players and support staff from coronavirus-transmission have yet to be developed, and a possible June 1 opening date would depend on safety standards and infection rates in the most populous U.S. state.  Newsom eased rules for local counties to make it easier for them to open restaurants for sit-down dining and retail outlets for in-store shopping.   In the San Francisco Bay Area, which was hit hard and early by the virus, health directors of five counties moved to loosen some restrictions that had lagged other parts of the state.  Businesses in those counties - San Francisco, Alameda, Santa Clara, Marin and Contra Costa - may open for manufacturing, retail with curbside pickup and warehouse distribution.  The modest loosening of public health restrictions put in place to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus pandemic comes after the number of new cases in the heavily populated region has remained stable or decreased over a two-week period, the directors said.  The San Francisco area, which includes California\u2019s storied Silicon Valley technology hub and the massive University of California at Berkeley, was the first in the state to report a cluster of coronavirus infections and the first to order residents to shelter at home.  In their new order issued Monday, the health directors said residents should still stay mostly at home, and requires people to wear face coverings when they are out.

Businesses must spend that money within the allotted time frame in order for the loans to be forgiven.  \u201cWe think probably taking it to 24 weeks would be appropriate to allow for restaurant owners that are participating in the program to be able to manage through and  rehire the employees, which is what the purpose of PPP was intended for,\u201d said Jose Cil, chief executive of Restaurant Brands International (QSR.TO), which includes fast food chains Burger King and Popeyes.   \u201cWe need those fixes now,\u201d said Sean Feeney, co-founder of New York-based Grovehouse restaurant company.  U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he was working on a technical fix to the PPP program that could extend the amount of time, but it may not be for 24 weeks. He said he had bipartisan support for the change.  On Sunday, Republican Senator Marco Rubio and Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen said they supported an extension.

Federal prosecutor John Durham is reviewing the origins of the investigation of Russia\u2019s 2016 election interference.   President Donald Trump in recent weeks has repeatedly referred to a scandal he calls \u201cObamagate,\u201d saying without evidence that Obama was tied to \u201cthe biggest political crime in American history.\u201d  Trump stepped up those claims as he faced criticism for the administration\u2019s handling of the coronavirus pandemic that has killed more than 88,000 Americans, and prepares to face Biden in the November election.    Barr added that the election should be decided strictly on policy debates, and that any investigation of a political candidate would need to be approved by him personally.  \u201cWe cannot allow this process to be hijacked by efforts to drum up criminal investigations of either candidate,\u201d Barr said.   Barr did not rule out the possibility of others being criminally investigated, without offering specifics.  Trump has not made clear what he is accusing Obama of doing, but the allegations appear to focus on law enforcement actions taken at the end of Obama\u2019s presidency.  Special Counsel Robert Mueller concluded in March 2019 that Russians had actively tried to interfere in the 2016 presidential election, both through the hacking of the Democratic National Committee\u2019s email system and through propaganda.  While his report documented numerous contacts between Trump\u2019s campaign and Russia, he said there was not sufficient evidence to prove there was a criminal conspiracy.  Russia has repeatedly denied trying to influence the election and Trump has dismissed the idea as a hoax.  Barr has faced scathing criticism from Democrats and former career prosecutors in recent months who say he is the one who has politicized the justice system in favor of allies of Trump.  Earlier this month, Barr moved to dismiss the criminal charges against Trump\u2019s former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who had already pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI.  In February he intervened to recommend a lighter sentence for Trump\u2019s longtime friend Roger Stone.  Reporting by Sarah N.

Reporting by Jeff Mason and Steve Holland; Editing by Sandra Maler","38":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Presumptive Democratic U.S. presidential nominee Joe Biden has been speaking regularly with former rival Elizabeth Warren on public health and economic relief ideas as he crafts more ambitious proposals aimed at helping Americans through the coronavirus crisis.  While Warren, a U.S. senator from Massachusetts and prominent voice on the Democratic Party\u2019s left, criticized the former vice president\u2019s approach on the campaign trail before dropping out and endorsing him, Biden advisers said the two see eye-to-eye on a number of issues.   In recent weeks, for example, Biden has endorsed Warren-backed ideas like canceling some student debt to help financially strapped Americans and echoed her calls for \u201cstructural change\u201d in an economy ravaged by the pandemic.  Biden is poised to challenge Republican President Donald Trump in the Nov. 3 election. Warren is thought to be on Biden\u2019s short list of possible vice presidential running mates along with Senators Kamala Harris and Amy Klobuchar, among others. A decision is not expected for weeks.  Warren and Biden have held telephone conversations since she exited the Democratic race in March, and now talk nearly weekly, according to people familiar with their discussions who spoke on condition of anonymity. The focus, according to one of the people, has been on public health and economic relief policy around a pandemic that has driven tens millions of Americans into unemployment.  \u201cLike Senator Warren, Joe Biden has been a champion for working families over corporations his entire career,\u201d Biden spokesman TJ Ducklo said, accusing Trump of pursuing policies favoring corporations and political allies over working Americans.  Ducklo added that Biden is working with Warren and \u201ca number of experienced voices\u201d to create plans to resolve the crisis and get help to Americans those who need it most.  Warren\u2019s office declined to comment on her conversations with Biden.  Biden has consulted other former rivals for the Democratic nomination including Washington state Governor Jay Inslee, while his team also seeks the support of policy groups on the left.  During the Democratic race, Warren chided Biden for holding high-dollar fundraisers and not embracing sufficiently sweeping economic change. But people close to Biden said he and Warren are more aligned ideologically than their public differences might suggest, particularly in their belief that the U.S. middle class has been eviscerated - even before the pandemic.  Biden\u2019s campaign on Sunday released a video showing him and Warren calling small-dollar donors together to thank them for their support. At one point, Biden joked that he never had as many contributors to thank until Warren\u2019s endorsement, a reference to her grassroots fundraising prowess.  \u201cI\u2019m counting on her a great deal - not just for her endorsement but for her ideas and her leadership,\u201d Biden said.  Biden already has begun embracing some Warren positions. In addition to the student-debt proposal, he joined Warren and Harris in their calls for federal health officials to release more data on racial disparities in the pandemic\u2019s impact on the U.S. population.  Biden and Warren this month co-authored an opinion piece in McClatchy newspapers demanding more oversight over trillions of dollars in federal coronavirus relief aid that they said included \u201cgiveaways to the wealthy and big corporations.\u201d   His rhetoric has shifted as well. Biden now talks about how the pandemic\u2019s damage to the economy has created a \u201cbig\u201d opportunity for \u201cstructural change,\u201d echoing Warren\u2019s campaign trail stump speech.  Last week, Biden said on his podcast that \u201cwe need some revolutionary institutional changes,\u201d a shift in language from when he said after his victory in the pivotal Feb. 29 South Carolina primary contest: \u201cTalk about revolution isn\u2019t changing anyone\u2019s life.\u201d  But Biden remains opposed to some Warren priorities such as her proposed Medicare for All government-run healthcare system or a wealth tax on billionaires.  Former President Barack Obama, under whom Biden served as vice president, last month praised Warren in the context of the pandemic, writing on Twitter that her proposals should serve as a model for policymakers. Biden and Obama speak regularly about his campaign.  \u201cJoe Biden has more license now to go really big with bold systematic economic polices and not be accused of flip-flopping in any way, but instead be admired for meeting the moment,\u201d said Adam Green, a co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, a policy advocacy group that backed Warren during the primary campaign.

Brent LCOc1 futures for July delivery rose $2.31, or 7.1%, to $34.81 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 rose $2.39, or 8.1%, to $31.82.

Citing unnamed U.S. and foreign government officials, the Post said the May 9 disruption of Iranian computers was presumably in retaliation for an earlier attempted cyberattack on rural water distribution systems in Israel.  The Israeli Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters on the Post report.   The managing director of Iran\u2019s Ports and Maritime Organization, Mohammad Rastad, told Iran\u2019s ILNA news agency last week that the cyberattack did not penetrate the organization\u2019s computers and was only able to infiltrate and damage a number of private operating systems.  A foreign government security official said, however, the attack was \u201chighly accurate\u201d and the damage to the Iranian port was more serious than described in official Iranian accounts, according to the Post.

The figure represents 9.61% of all deaths worldwide, according to data compiled by Reuters.","46":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump may have fired State Department Inspector General Steve Linick because he was investigating U.S. military sales to Saudi Arabia, Democratic lawmakers said on Monday, although Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he sought Linick\u2019s removal because his work was undermining the department.  Trump announced the planned removal of Linick in a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi late on Friday. He was the fourth government inspector general that the Republican president has ousted in recent weeks.  Pompeo told the Washington Post he had asked Trump to fire Linick, while declining to describe specific concerns. Pompeo said no reason had to be given, contradicting Congress\u2019 interpretation of the inspector general law.  \u201cI went to the president and made clear to him that Inspector General Linick wasn\u2019t performing a function in a way that we had tried to get him to, that was additive for the State Department,\u201d Pompeo said.  Another State official told the Post concern over Linick had grown because of leaks about investigations, although there was no evidence Linick was responsible.  Representative Eliot Engel, chairman of the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee, and Senator Bob Menendez, ranking member on Senate Foreign Relations, said Linick had been investigating Trump\u2019s declaration of a national emergency last year to clear the way for $8 billion in military sales, mostly to Saudi Arabia.  Engel and Menendez announced on Saturday they were launching an investigation of Linick\u2019s firing.  \u201cI have learned that there may be another reason for Mr. Linick\u2019s firing. His office was investigating - at my request - Trump\u2019s phony declaration of an emergency so he could send weapons to Saudi Arabia,\u201d Engel said in a statement.  Engel called on the administration to comply with the probe and turn over records by Friday.  Engel\u2019s statement was first reported by the Washington Post.  Congressional aides had said Linick was investigating whether Pompeo misused a taxpayer-funded political appointee to perform personal tasks for himself and his wife.  Trump said Linick had been appointed by former Democratic President Barack Obama, and that he knew nothing about him, but had the right to terminate him. \u201cI just go rid of him,\u201d he said.  Trump infuriated many members of Congress last May, including some Republicans, by declaring a national emergency related to tensions with Iran to sidestep congressional review and push ahead with $8 billion in military sales, mostly to Saudi Arabia.  The House and Senate passed resolutions to block the sales. But Trump, a staunch promoter of both arms sales and ties to Saudi Arabia, vetoed them. The Republican-led Senate upheld his veto.  Menendez said he believed Linick was close to coming to a conclusion in his investigation of the arms sales. He also introduced legislation to protect inspectors general.  Some Republicans also expressed concern.   Senator Chuck Grassley wrote to Trump and asked for a detailed explanation of Linick\u2019s removal by June 1.  \u201cCongress\u2019s intent is clear that an expression of lost confidence, without further explanation, is not sufficient to fulfill the requirements of the IG Reform Act,\u201d Grassley said.  Representative Michael McCaul, top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs committee, was looking into the matter, a spokeswoman said.  Trump replaced Linick with Stephen Akard, an official in charge of the Office of Foreign Missions considered a close ally of Vice President Mike Pence.  Explaining Linick\u2019s firing to Pelosi, Trump said only that he no longer had \u201cfullest confidence\u201d in Linick.  Pelosi wrote to Trump and asked him to provide \u201cdetailed and substantial justification\u201d for Linick\u2019s removal within 30 days.

She is one of hundreds of thousands of garment workers across Asia who have been laid off, according to the Workers Rights Consortium, a labour rights campaign group, and are now struggling to survive with little welfare support, mired in debt and in many cases reliant on food handouts.  \u201cIf I have a job and an income, I can pay for medical treatment for my mother,\u201d Zarchi Lwin, 29, told Reuters from the home she shares with her 56-year-old mother, who has lung disease, in a shanty town on the outskirts of Yangon. \u201cNow no income, no job,\u201d she said, fighting back tears. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d  Next temporarily closed all its stores in Britain in March due to the coronavirus. The company said in a statement it had only cancelled some orders and \u201cendeavoured to be fair\u201d to its suppliers. KGG, the factory where Zarchi Lwin worked, did not respond to requests for comment.  Since the 1960s, Asia has grown into the world\u2019s garment factory, sending about $670 billion worth of clothes, shoes and bags a year to Europe, the United States and richer Asian countries, according to the International Labour Organization, a United Nations agency.  After non-essential stores were closed in many countries and people were told to stay at home to prevent further spread of the disease, international retailers from ASOS Plc to New Look said they cancelled orders with garment makers. Factory owners in Myanmar, Bangladesh and Cambodia immediately shut down thousands of factories and sent home workers with little or no pay.  Retailers generally place orders at least three months ahead of delivery and pay for the finished product when it is delivered. Initially most retailers cancelled all outstanding orders, but many adjusted their position in March and April after a public outcry, agreeing to pay for goods that had already been manufactured or were mid-production.   To finish pending orders, about half of Bangladesh\u2019s 4,000 garment factories have reopened, according to garment manufacturer associations. About 150 of Myanmar\u2019s 600 or so factories have shut down, while 200 out of 600 or so are closed in Cambodia.  Many factories that have reopened are struggling to enforce social distancing and good hygiene practices in often cramped conditions, two union officials told Reuters. \u201cMost of the factories are not complying with the safety guidelines,\u201d said Babul Akter, president of the Bangladesh Garment and Industrial Workers Federation, adding that dozens of garment workers had been infected with the virus. \u201cJust placing hand-washing systems and checking temperatures at the entrances will not help. Inside the factories, when the workers work so closely, how will they maintain safe distancing?\u201d   Some orders have been trickling back. Swedish fashion retailer H&M said it only paused orders for two weeks at the height of the virus outbreak. U.S.-based Walmart Inc, the world\u2019s largest retailer, said it placed new orders with Asian manufacturers last month.   For a list of retailers and the status of their orders with Asian garment makers, see FACTBOX  Despite the new orders, several garment manufacturers said the low volume of work on the books means many factories in Myanmar, Bangladesh, and Cambodia will not be viable, which means many of the young women who make up the majority of the workforce will no longer have jobs. That leaves them torn between returning to families in the countryside, where there are few employment opportunities, or enduring life in the city in the hope that factories will reopen at full capacity.   The European Union has created a wage fund for workers in Myanmar worth 5 million euros ($5.3 million) to pay a portion of the salaries of the most vulnerable for three months. Myanmar has promised to cover 40% of the salaries of laid off workers. More than 58,000 have been laid off, according to the country\u2019s garment manufacturer association.  In Bangladesh, one million workers were furloughed or laid off by late March, according to the Penn State Center for Global Workers\u2019 Rights, although some have since returned to work. About 75,000 have not been paid for March, according to the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA), which estimates tens of thousands more will not be paid wages owed to them.   The government has announced a $588 million aid package for its export sector to help pay employees. Garment manufacturers, which estimate they have lost almost $3 billion in exports since the start of April, said the funds are not enough. Foreign-owned firms and joint ventures are not eligible for payments.  In Cambodia, where about 60,000 garment workers have been \u201csuspended,\u201d according to the country\u2019s manufacturer association, workers have been promised $70 per month - $40 from the government and $30 from the employer - but that amounts to just over a third of the current minimum wage.  In that country\u2019s capital, Phnom Penh, 39-year-old Rom Phary said she and her husband had racked up $550 of debt and interest since she lost her factory job in early March, several times her monthly salary. She said she and her family are living off rice donated by an NGO, the Center for Alliance of Labor and Human Rights, which is working in Cambodia. Phary said she persuaded her landlord to let her stay rent-free rather than forcing the family to return to relatives in the provinces.  \u201cIf we go back, it would be shameful. We don\u2019t know what we would do,\u201d she said.      In Myanmar the garment industry was the fastest-growing sector of the economy, accounting for about 10% of the country\u2019s exports and offering an escape route from extreme poverty for hundreds of thousands of people, many of them migrants from rural areas.  In Dagon Seikkan, an industrial zone on the outskirts of Yangon that is home for many migrant workers, local officials have been giving out rations of free rice to those who have been without jobs for some time. But Zarchi Lwin said she did not qualify as she was employed up until recently.  She and her parents left their small village in the central Magwe region six years ago after selling their house to pay for treatment for her brother, who eventually died from kidney disease. At first, they worked as cleaners and lived in a dormitory. Then Zarchi Lwin trained herself to sew clothes and secured a sought-after job at one of the nearby factories, earning $146 per month: enough for food, rent of a small wooden shack, and medical treatment. She saved up for a year to buy the bangles she pawned, she said.  Sobbing, she recounted how her mother told her she wants to die in order to lessen the financial burden on the family. \u201cSometimes I want to kill myself because of this situation,\u201d  she said. Her father, a guard at a furniture factory, has also lost his income.   Before the new coronavirus, garment workers in Yangon and the neighbouring province of Bago were sending more than 40 million euros ($43 million) in remittances to their hometowns and villages across the country each month, said Jacob Clere of SMART Textile and Garments, a European Union-funded project.  \u201cEducation for children who would otherwise not have it. Medicine for grandmothers who would otherwise go without. Healthy food. Better shelter,\u201d said Clere, describing how that money helped rural communities. Many are now at risk of being forced into early marriage or taking on debt from loan sharks at very high rates, said Mike Slingsby, a regional urban poverty specialist.   HIGH-INTEREST DEBTS  In Bangladesh, the world\u2019s second-largest garment maker behind China, 4.1 million workers or 2.5% of the population worked in garment factories, many of which are now closed. About 70% of Dhaka\u2019s garment industry workers left the city to return to their villages, said Tuomo Poutiainen of the International Labour Organization, although he said some have since returned after some factories reopened to finish work on existing contracts.  Orders for June are down 45% from a year ago, according to Rubana Huq, president of the BGMEA.  Banesa Begum, a 21-year-old worker laid off from a Dhaka factory making clothes for Zara, among other brands, said she had nothing to send to her parents, subsistence farmers in the northern district of Rangpur. \u201cI know they are starving,\u201d she said.  Inditex, the owner of Zara, told Reuters it will pay for orders from garment makers, whether finished or in production, according to the original payment schedule.  Begum\u2019s salary also paid for her two young brothers to go to school. \u201cI don\u2019t know how I\u2019ll manage money to continue their study,\u201d she said. \u201cAll my dreams are shattered.\u201d  Reporting by Thu Thu Aung in Yangon, Ruma Paul in Dhaka, Poppy McPherson in Bangkok, Prak Chan Thul in Phnom Penh, Sonya Dowsett in Madrid and James Davey in London; Writing by Poppy McPherson; Editing by Bill Rigby","49":"PARIS (Reuters) - Youths clashed with police into the early hours of Monday in a Paris suburb after the death of a young man in a motorcycle accident, which some in the community blamed on the police, Le Parisien newspaper and residents reported.

The SEC said the three former KPMG employees violated auditor integrity rules, part of charges against KPMG for which the auditing firm paid a $50 million fine last year. Former KPMG auditors Timothy Daly, Michael Bellach, and John Donovan each engaged in misconduct in relation to exams that the firm used to test that auditors, the agency said in a statement.  In 2018, Bellach texted Daly images of questions and answers to a required training exam, the SEC said. According to the agency, Donovan also received answers to training exams from subordinates on several occasions and shared answers with others at times that year.  Lawyers for each of the individuals charged did not respond immediately to requests for comment.  \u201cThese actions reflect our commitment to hold these gatekeepers responsible for breaches of their professional obligations,\u201d said Steven Peikin, co-director of the SEC\u2019s enforcement division.   In 2019, KPMG agreed to the penalty to settle allegations of employees\u2019 cheating as well as charges that former staffers used stolen information to alter some of the accounting firm\u2019s previous audit work.  A KPMG spokesperson said in a statement on Monday: \u201cWe are a stronger firm as a result of the actions we are taking to strengthen our culture, governance and compliance program.\u201d  The former KPMG auditors did not admit or deny the findings, the SEC said. Daly, Bellach, and Donovan agreed to be suspended from appearing or practicing before the SEC as accountants, with the right to apply for reinstatement after three years, two years, and one year, respectively.

Hong Kong futures were up 1.8% and Australian shares were also set to open higher. Nikkei futures were trading above the Nikkei 225 index\u2019s previous close, pointing to an opening gain of about 2%.  Data from Moderna Inc\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine, the first to be tested in the United States, showed that it produced protective antibodies in a small group of healthy volunteers, the company said on Monday. Shares of the pharmaceutical company surged.  There are currently no approved treatments or vaccines for COVID-19, and experts predict a safe and effective vaccine could take 12 to 18 months to develop.  On Wall Street, the benchmark S&P 500 posted its biggest one-day percentage gain in almost six weeks, gaining 3.15%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 3.85% and the Nasdaq Composite added 2.44%.  The vaccine optimism sent treasury yields surging and pulled gold off its highest peak since October 2012. Spot prices were up 0.07%.  The pan-European STOXX 600 index closed up 4.1%, its biggest one-day percentage gain since March 24. France and Germany on Monday called for the creation of a 500 billion euro ($543 billion) Recovery Fund able to offer grants to the countries and regions hardest hit by the coronavirus crisis.  Epicenters of the outbreak including New York, Italy and Spain are gradually lifting restrictions that have kept millions cooped up, while warmer weather has enticed people in many parts of the world to emerge from their lockdowns.  \u201cBusiness survey data for the U.S. improved to merely terrible in May, up from truly awful in April. But collectively these data support our forecast that monthly activity measures from May onward should, in general, start to look better as restrictions are gradually eased,\u201d JP Morgan Chase economists said in a note on Tuesday.   Meanwhile, 8.16% of U.S. mortgages are in forbearance, a weekly industry survey showed. That figure was up from 7.91% previously, the smallest increase since mid-March.  Oil prices jumped to their highest in over two months, as the easing of global lockdowns boosted hopes of economic activity and as producers appeared to be following through with planned production cuts.

The rocket was launched from an eastern district of Baghdad, according to the statement.  Reporting by Ahmed Rasheed; Editing by Himani Sarkar","54":"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico\u2019s government will likely directly grant the contract for the fourth phase of its \u201cMayan Train\u201d project to Mexican construction company ICA (ICA.MX) without a bidding process, the head of the tourism authority was quoted as saying on Monday.  The rail project is a top priority of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who hopes it will be a major generator of jobs in Mexico\u2019s poorer south.  Rogelio Jimenez, head of the National Fund for Tourism Promotion (Fonatur), told Mexican newspaper El Financiero that ICA already holds the concession for a highway running along the planned train line from Izamal in Yucatan state to Cancun in Quintana Roo state.  \u201cIt\u2019s the simplest way, since it has the concession... It has to be directly awarded, taking them out and putting in another company is more complicated,\u201d he said.  A Fonatur spokesman said further details would be announced in the coming days.   Contracts for the first, second and third phases of the train were granted through public bidding contests that attracted dozens of companies. Winners included firms controlled by Mexican tycoon Carlos Slim.   The 1,470-km (913-mile) rail line is designed to connect tourist hot spots from Chiapas state to the Yucatan Peninsula along the Caribbean coast, including the popular Maya ruins of Palenque and Chichen Itza to the beach resort Cancun.  ICA had also been tapped to help build a $13 billion Mexico City airport, a flagship project of former President Enrique Pena Nieto that was scrapped by his successor Lopez Obrador, who claimed it was too costly and tainted by corruption.
