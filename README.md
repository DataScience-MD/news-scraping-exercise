## About
This repository contains code and supporting documents for the News Scraping exercise.  Modifications to this code were made by the Bad Ozone Grasshoppers.

## BLUF
**Requirements:** Construct a web scraping module to extract information from a U.S. News site.  

**Proposed Solution:** Create a python script that retrieves the top ***X (future qty pending finilization)*** articles from site ***x (site pending finilization)***.  A Colab notebook will then be used to load all relevent libraries, github code, execute the script, and then save the resulting information.  This approach is being performed as it enables execution of the code from any location regardless of client configuration.  

**Task List**
* [ ] Primary task: Construct a web scraping module for a U.S. News site
  * [ ] Secondary Task: Build Colab notebook that runs web scraping module
  * [ ] Secondary Task: Create requirements file to faciliate dependancy installation
  * [ ] Secondary Task: Build section in colab notebook that exports data to user's google drive
  * [ ] TODO Add New feature, execute news_reauters with selenium using chrome or firefox based on a passed variable with error checking
